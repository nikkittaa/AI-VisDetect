            "['It is generally agreed that society benefits from the work of its members, and there are many different types of work that contribute to the betterment of society. Some people contribute through their work as artists, while others contribute through their work as scientists. While both artists and scientists make important contributions to society, it is difficult to say which type of contribution is valued more by any particular society.\\nArtists contribute to society in a number of ways. They create works of art that are enjoyed by people all around the world, and their creations often have a deep emotional impact on those who experience them. Whether it is a painting, a sculpture, a film, or a piece of music, art has the power to move people in ways that few other things can. In addition to providing enjoyment and emotional fulfillment, art can also serve as a means of self-expression, and can be used to convey important ideas and messages to others.\\nScientists, on the other hand, contribute to society through their research and discoveries. Their work helps us to understand the world around us and to solve some of the most pressing problems facing humanity. Scientists work in a variety of fields, including biology, physics, chemistry, and many others, and their contributions have led to countless innovations and technological advancements that have improved our lives in countless ways.\\nIt is difficult to say which type of contribution is valued more by any particular society, as this can vary widely depending on the specific culture and values of that society. Some societies may place a higher value on the contributions of scientists, while others may place a higher value on the contributions of artists. Ultimately, both types of contributions are important and valuable in their own ways, and society as a whole benefits from the work of both scientists and artists.'\n",
            " 'Modern technology has undoubtedly had a significant impact on the way people around the world live and interact with each other. With the proliferation of the internet and social media, it is easier than ever for people to access information and connect with others across cultural and geographical boundaries. As a result, some people argue that modern technology is creating a single world culture, in which people from different cultures are increasingly influenced by and exposed to the same ideas and norms.\\nHowever, I disagree with the statement that modern technology is creating a single world culture. While it is true that technology has made it easier for people to access information and connect with others around the world, it has also allowed people to maintain and celebrate their unique cultural identities.\\nFor example, consider the role of social media in promoting cultural traditions and customs. Many people use social media platforms to share photos, videos, and stories about their cultural practices and celebrations, allowing others to learn about and appreciate the diversity of cultures around the world. This is especially true for marginalized or minority cultures that may not have as much representation in mainstream media.\\nFurthermore, technology has also allowed people to easily connect with and engage in online communities centered around specific cultural identities or interests. These communities provide a space for people to share their experiences, traditions, and values with others who share similar backgrounds, further reinforcing their cultural identities.\\nIn addition, modern technology has not necessarily led to a homogenization of cultural practices or values. While it is true that people around the world may be exposed to similar ideas and trends through the internet and social media, they are also free to choose which ones they adopt and which ones they reject. For example, while some people may embrace Western fashion trends, others may prefer to maintain traditional clothing styles. Similarly, while some people may adopt Western cultural practices, others may maintain their own traditional customs and traditions.\\nIn conclusion, while modern technology has undoubtedly facilitated the sharing of information and ideas across cultural boundaries, it has not necessarily led to the creation of a single world culture. Instead, technology has allowed people to celebrate and maintain their unique cultural identities while also learning about and appreciating the diversity of cultures around the world.'\n",
            " 'A person I know is planning to move to my town, and I believe they would both like and dislike certain aspects of living here.\\nOn the positive side, my town has a strong sense of community. There are numerous events and activities throughout the year, such as festivals, farmers markets, and parades, which bring people together and foster a sense of belonging. Additionally, my town is relatively small, so it has a friendly and welcoming atmosphere.\\nHowever, there are also a few downsides to living in my town. One potential issue is the lack of diversity in terms of both culture and recreational activities. While there are some local restaurants and shops that offer a variety of cuisines, the town as a whole is predominantly homogeneous. Additionally, there are not many options for entertainment or nightlife, so those looking for a more vibrant social scene may be disappointed.\\nAnother potential concern is the cost of living, which is relatively high compared to surrounding areas. Housing prices and property taxes are significantly higher in my town, which could be a challenge for those on a fixed budget.\\nOverall, while my town has a strong sense of community and a friendly atmosphere, it may not be the best fit for everyone due to its lack of diversity and higher cost of living. However, for those who value a close-knit community and appreciate a more relaxed pace of life, my town could be an ideal place to call home.'\n",
            " \"For the last five years of my life, I have been living with roommates - a long enough time for me to know the kinds of people I prefer to live with, and the kinds that don’t want to be around. Which is why, when I was told that I needed to share a room with another girl, I decided to do the choosing myself.\\nThis would not be such an easy choice to make, but at least I had a few points on my side. First of all, I had lived in this one town all my life, and I had so many friends going to university at the same time as myself, so it would be no problem finding someone willing to share with me. Also, I figured that if I let the authorities chose someone for me to live with, then they probably would chose someone that I had never known before, and because it is so hard for me to make friends, I would take a very long time to get used to this new person.\\nWith this in mind I decided that letting the school chose someone for me is not a good idea. Also, it would be so much better if I chose someone for myself because I have a lot of rules that govern my life and I expect whoever I live with to follow them. I sleep very early at night, something that many young people I know don't do. There is no guarantee that the person the school chooses for me is going to sleep as early as I do, therefore the most logical option is for me to find someone that can fit my needs. Also I am a vegetarian, and the slightest smell of meat anywhere around the house can make me get very sick, so I need to be sure that the person I live with either is a vegetarian like myself or is going to remember never to bring meat around me. The most important factor in me wanting to choose a roommate of my own is the fact that I love animals. Wherever I have lived, I have always had at least three cats living with me. I love animals so much and I possibly cannot live without them. Not everyone however shares this same passion that I do, infect, many young people do not have time to care for pets, and don't especially like them, or worst, are allergic to them. For this reason I need to find someone that shares this passion with me, or at least doesn't mind having pets around the house. If the school was to choose someone with whom I was so live, then for all I know, it could be someone who cannot stand the sight of pets.\\nOne last reason I would want to choose a roommate for myself is the fact that I have a best friend with whom I have been sharing flats for five years. Now, both of us are accepted into this university, and I would love to continue being with her. We both get along very well, and I don't need to put in extra effort to start a good relationship all over again.\\nFor these reasons, it is clear to me that I would never want the school authorities to find a flat mate for me when I can find one for myself - especially one that will completely suit me.\"\n",
            " 'In the one point of view, it is one of the man’s characters to be curious. He wants to break the limits and learn more. No one can oppose to this quality of human. This curiosity caused many inventions and profits for the people around the world. In the other hand, we live together and we should think about others, have compassion for them and give their due. It is not fair that governments notice on their points and don’t think that it may harm other people. In my opinion, governments should spend money for our basic needs on earth and stop spending money for outer space researches.\\nIf one person deprived himself and his family from eating to buy and run a car, we may consider him mad. It is not acceptable to spend millions of money’s funds and expenditures for space researches while there are many people around the world who have a severe lack of food, water, and hygiene and many other primary necessities. When we see that there is many violent thugs, suicides, robberies and divorces occur in our society and most of these problems are because of lack of money or poverty, It is not conventional to squander this huge amount of money for traveling to space while many essential requirements have not answered yet.\\nMany times, we see from our television or read from news that our earth is in a very bad condition. Deforesting caused many jungles destroyed; air pollution is going to be a very dangerous problem and so on. It is utterly absurd that governments waste this amount of money while our earth, the only place for us to live; situation deteriorates every day so fast.\\nAt last but not the least, there are still many troubles in our society and earth in that many people die because of lack of food and water supply in the 20th century what is not a negligible problem. Furthermore, our earth is going to be an intolerable place to live providing we don’t find out a solution for it. It’s better to government focus their money on the people and earth problems first and then let space look after itself.'\n",
            " 'Language is the best mean of communication. In globalization era, one language is definitely not enough for one to be able to communicate well with foreigner. I strongly support the idea that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. They will get themselves familiar with new language, improve hearing ability as the time goes by, and learn to speak new word early.\\nIn my country, Thailand, it is compulsory for all children to start learning English at the age of three or four. However, they learn only a few word like one, two, three and simple animal names. It is more fun to know other languages especially when children begin to learn with very easy vocabulary. The learning process is more fun for them. Most language books for kids are colorful and fun to read. It gets children familiar with new languages without feeling afraid or bore to learn.\\nNo doubt, early start means more time for practice. Children can improve their hearing ability from foreign movie, songs, or from tourists. They might not be able to understand the whole conversation but they will hear the word they have learned and know how to pronounce them correctly. I have read the book about bringing up a child where parents speak two languages; there is no problem for a child to learn two languages at the same time. Psychologist said a child will not get confuse but he will be able to speak two languages which will surely be one asset for the future.\\nIn addition, children would start to say a word or sentence early and do not worry so much about mistake as most adults do. You cannot refuse the fact that adults always concern more about grammar and pronunciation of the new languages. This is one of the big barriers for learning. Adults are afraid and not say at all afterward. Language is a matter of practicing not avoiding. Children will start to say what they learn regardless of rule or grammatical part. And that is the best way to learn language.\\nTo me, children can receive new things fast and their development is always progressing. Time and practice will make them master in new language, which will benefit them when they grow up. All in all, language is an art, which one should learn as early as possible. If one wants to see outcome soon, one must start sooner.\\n  \\n '\n",
            " \"I disagree that reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies. Of course I know the advantage of reading fictions. For example, I can bring my favorite book in the train to read during commuting or traveling. Also, it is a good idea to read novels to kill my time when taking a boring lecture. I can soon go into the world in the book and enjoy seeking what happens next with a lot of imagination alone. People often say that reading books develop children's creativity and I agree that. However, I enjoy watching movies more than reading something for the following reasons.\\nFirst of all, it is easy to have a fun with movies. Even if we don't watch a movie from the start, we will know soon what is going on in the story. Screens where characters act through a camera make audience pay attention easily because of the visual scenes and sound. The mixture of clear, beautiful or horrible pictures and its matched sounds have great effect on audience so that they will not forget the scenes.\\nSecond, if you like a character in a movie, you can be excited in not only the flow of the story but also keeping watching the person. Moreover, I would like to get items characters in films use and imitate their fashions; we can get a lot of hints and ideas, which make our daily lives more comfortable and enjoyable.\\nWatching one movie with friends is also a happy time. After watching it, we will chat about the stories, characters and what each of us felt. We talk and listen to them and give our own judgment. We can do such a thing because we can watch movies with more that two people at the same time, on the other hand, reading books tend to enjoy alone.\\nThus, I prefer watching movies to reading fictions. Through movies, especially which we can see at movie theaters now, we can have a lively conversation and get to know today's popularity.\"\n",
            " 'Technology as we all know has changed the way we live our lives in this new millennium. It has affected each and every faucet of people from all countries irrespective of cultural and physical boundaries. Now many people may argue with the fact that, not all change brought due to the technological revolution has resulted in progress for the human kind. But I strongly support the argument that technology has made the world a better place to live. I will explain my point of view with examples and reasoning in the following paragraphs.\\nFirst of all, technology has improved the quality of our lives. For example, in our working lives where we use computers, which help us plan and execute our work faster. And also for instance the communication technology, which has revolutionized the way people around the world, talk and share information. Previously, pigeons were used to transmit information, now due to efforts of many scientists and organizations we have mediums such as e-mail, telephone, fax which allow people to share information, in ways which was never thought possible before. All this results in people meeting and sharing thoughts and exchanging knowledge, which eventually leads to betterment of mankind.\\nSecondly, It has made it possible to do things unimagined before. For instance, it was never thought possible to cure people of some diseases and disabilities. But path breaking applications of radioactive isotopes in cancer treatment and artificial limb implants in disabled persons are some instances where technology has given people a new ray of hope.\\nIt has also resulted in increasing the efficiency of humans. A good example of this are the machines used in factories which are 1000 times more efficient in doing some repetitive tasks compared to humans. This results in industry being able to supply the increasing demands of the ever-increasing population. Good examples of this are cars and packaged food products.\\nTechnology has also given us a second chance in case of unexpected events like diseases and natural calamities. Because of technology we can better respond to these problems. For example, vaccines are used extensively throughout the world when any particular pandemic or epidemic breaks out and now less life are lost due to natural disasters than before, thanks to the state of the art search and rescue equipment.\\nLastly, it has given us a purpose of our life. For example space technology has strived to explain our origins in the universe. Meanwhile also finding the roots of our own evolution. All this results in a better understanding of the forces of nature controlling our existence and better utilizing them for our own good.\\nIn conclusion, I fully support the statement that technology has made our world a better place to live and also gives us a means by which we can preserve the best of our world for future generations to come.'\n",
            " 'Someone says that a person should make an important decision alone, but in my opinion, I think that it is not true because everything can be looked in various aspects, and everyone has different skill and experiences. Consequently, consulting other persons is the best way for making a decision.\\nIn my point of view, anyone in this world thinks differently from any other persons because there are many aspects for thinking about something. The more the number of people who help think, the more idea, so a person should not make an important decision alone. For example, in prominent company, it is very famous to work with team because the more the number of co-workers, the more a number of good ideas. Everyone has a chance to propose his opinion, and all of these opinions will be merged to be the conclusion decision.\\nIn addition, making a decision alone can make people waste many things such as money, friends, or life because no one have a good skill in every fields. For example, in the business, if owner want to increase budget to develop a company, but he decides to do so by himself without consulting with accountancies that are good at calculating budget, the business may be turn down. So, the owner has to waste a lot of money because he makes an importance decision alone.\\nMoreover, it is sure that everyone cannot used to face with the same situation in his whole life, so no one has the same experiences, as do any other persons. Doing something that we used to do is easy and has less chance to do wrong, so If a person has to decide to do something that he used not to do so, but he consult with someone who used to do so, he can do so too. For example, last 6 years ago, I had to decide in which faculty that I should study. In that time, I had not many experiences, so I asked about the characteristic of any faculties from my parents, my teachers, and my parent’s friends who work in various careers. Those advices that everyone gave me were very useful for me to make a decision, and right now I am sure that I do not make a wrong decision that I choose to learn in the faculty of Electrical Engineering. If that time I decided to choose it by myself, I might be a doctor who was not happy at all.\\nTo conclude, making an important decision is the important thing in people’s life because it can point out our life such as being the rich or the poor, working as an engineer or a doctor, or being happy or sad. The best way for making a decision is consulting with other person. Therefore I agree that a person should never make an important decision alone.'\n",
            " \"The people in our community welcomed the announcement of the government's plan to build a university. In fact, majority proposed that our community is a good place to locate the university. I whole-heartedly support their proposal.\\nBuilding a new university can offer a lot of opportunities to everybody. First, it will provide an excellent alternative to the existing university, which, unfortunately, cannot accommodate the growing numbers of students each year. Secondly, this will stop monopoly of education resulting to stagnation of the quality of education by creating a healthy competition to other institution to maintain and improve their standards of education.\\nMoreover, students can now have the options to choose which university they prefer and take courses, which they really like.\\nA new university also means more job opportunities especially for teachers, administrative staff and others who are in need of employment.\\nHowever, a new university can also create problems to the community, more universities in the community do not immediately mean better education. Sometimes, the quality of education suffers from quantity because school administrators tend to commercialize education to attract more students. The policies may become lax; the rules may bend to accommodate the whims of students in order to keep them.\\nA new university would also lead to an increase of migration of people who would like to avail higher education. This can lead to increased pollution and even crimes. The once peaceful community may become noisy and chaotic because of the increased number of people with different personalities.\\nIn the end, all things in this world have advantages and disadvantages. In this case, even if building a new university can increase pollution, or even crimes, bring noise and possible chaos to the community, the benefits that it will give the people, especially the youth in providing them the means to finish their education and prepare them for their future life can outweigh all disadvantages.\"\n",
            " \"It is a commonly accepted fact that society benefits from the work of its members. Some of them are more inclined to artistic forms of creation, while others prefer working in a scientific framework. Both scientists and artists contribute to the society in their own way. Works of artists affect people's state of mind, and works of scientists affect their everyday life. In my opinion, scientific work is more valued by the modern society.\\nArtists make art, and art makes people feel better. Artistic creations may be more or less valuable, from the connoisseur's point of view, but nevertheless, some people find them enjoyable and pleasing. For instance, looking at a beautiful picture or listening to Beethoven's symphony seems very relaxing after a hard day spent in the office. Furthermore, museums and galleries all over the world are made possible by the work of the generations of artists, from the ancient times until today. Without the museums and galleries, men of modern age would not be able to improve their knowledge about past times. Therefore, education is also the important role of artists. The art enriches people's spirits and makes them more imaginative; while at the same time teaches them about historical events.\\nScientists contribute to the society in a different way. Their influence is of more material, and less spiritual nature. For example, physicists try to determine the laws of nature and engineers then use that knowledge in order to make various devices and systems. Those products of joint efforts of physics and engineering make ordinary people's lives easier. Just think about the difference that was made by the invention of microwave ovens for example.\\nIt is my opinion that science is more appreciated than art by the modern society. There are several reasons that lead to this conclusion. People find it easier to accept information in material, than in spiritual form. For example, using typical products of science, such as computers or TVs, doesn't require much mental effort, while art can sometimes be obscure and hard to grasp. Furthermore, in many countries, science receives generous financial support from the government, while art seldom does. This is because a country's military and economic power is dominantly affected by its science, not art. Therefore, scientists are played much better than artists. In fact, having art as a sole profession is very unlikely to provide enough money to support a family, for instance. Even though some people become fascinated with art classes while in school, later in life they are usually forced to move towards more scientific fields of work, such as economics or engineering.\\nIn conclusion, scientists and artists both have their ways of contributing to the society. Artists affect people's lives in the spiritual sense, by forming their life views, educating them, or simply by relaxing them when they are tired and exhausted. On the other hand, science affects material side of life, by creating inventions that relieve people of hard work, thus making them have more free time. Science is more appreciated than art in modern society, because science is more precise and easier to understand, while art can be abstruse. Also, science is more important for the country's economy and army, which makes it more interesting for the government.\"\n",

Gandhi was an Indian independence activist who is best known for his philosophy of nonviolence and his role in leading the Indian National Congress to independence from British rule.\\nThere are several reasons why I believe Gandhi would be an excellent choice for a statue or monument in my city. First and foremost, Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence has inspired people around the world to seek peaceful resolutions to conflicts and to stand up for their beliefs in a peaceful manner. This message is particularly relevant in today's world, where violence and conflict seem to be all too common. A statue or monument honoring Gandhi would serve as a reminder to the people of my city to strive for peace and to respect the beliefs and rights of others.\\nAnother reason I believe Gandhi would be an excellent choice for a statue or monument in my city is his role in leading the Indian National Congress to independence from British rule. Gandhi was a key figure in the Indian independence movement, and his leadership and determination were instrumental in achieving independence for India. A statue or monument honoring Gandhi would serve as a tribute to his contributions to the independence of my country, and would be a source of inspiration and pride for the people of my city.\\nFinally, Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence and his role in the Indian independence movement have made him an iconic figure in the history of my country. His legacy continues to inspire people around the world, and a statue or monument honoring him in my city would be a fitting tribute to his contributions and an important reminder of the values he stood for.\\nIn conclusion, if my city were to build a statue or monument to honor a famous person in my country, I would choose Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence and his role in leading the Indian National Congress to independence from British rule make him an excellent choice for such an honor, and a statue or monument honoring him would serve as a reminder of the importance of peace and the values he stood for.\"\n",
            " '\"People will work because they need money to live.\" Though I do believe that there are a lot of other reasons for people to work. I will enumerate each of these reasons in the following paragraphs.\\nAccording to me, all of us have an inbuilt burning desire to SUCCEED. Success is a combination of professional achievements and then earning money as a result of these. Even if one of these components is missing, one will not derive true pleasure of having succeeded. Thus it is a big chain of events, one enjoys one\\'s work, the moment one\\'s work is not to complete a job but an enjoyment, and one works even harder. More hard work over the long run inevitably leads to professional excellence, which in turn translates in monetary benefits.\\nSecondly, when a person works hard, he contributes directly or indirectly to society. This feeling that \"I have some worth and am contributing to betterment of society\" is very important for mental happiness. Being an orthopedic surgeon myself, I have experienced this numerous times. If a patient comes to me with a fracture and then goes home walking, the pleasure I derive is phenomenal even if I do not derive substantial monetary benefit from this.\\nI also want to add that work gives money and in this day and age, even for social work one might want to do, one needs funds. Money thus earned can be given for various charitable causes thus giving a tremendous sense of satisfaction and well-being.\\nI therefore strongly believe that one of the important reasons that people work is for money for them and for their family, there are many, significantly more important reasons for working and these are the ones, which actually keeps life going.'\n",

One thing, a fast free and reliable Internet service could improve in my hometown is the way people work. If there is this said service people in my hometown must not necessarily commute to a far place to do their job.

            " 'Playing games has always been thought to be important to the development of well-balanced and creative children; however, what part, if any, they should play in the lives of adults has never been researched that deeply. I believe that playing games is every bit as important for adults as for children. Not only is taking time out to play games with our children and other adults valuable to building interpersonal relationships but is also a wonderful way to release built up tension.\\nThere\\'s nothing my husband enjoys more after a hard day of work than to come home and play a game of Chess with someone. This enables him to unwind from the day\\'s activities and to discuss the highs and lows of the day in a non-threatening, kick back environment. A close friend received one of my most memorable wedding gifts, a Backgammon set. I asked him why in the world he had given us such a gift. He replied that he felt that an important aspect of marriage was for a couple to never quit playing games together. Over the years, as I have come to purchase and play, with other couples & coworkers, many games like: Monopoly, Chutes & Ladders, Mastermind, Dweebs, Geeks, & Weirdoes, etc. I can reflect on the integral part they have played in our weekends and our \"shut-off the T.V. and do something more stimulating\" weeks. They have enriched my life and made it more interesting. Sadly, many adults forget that games even exist and have put them away in the cupboards, forgotten until the grandchildren come over.\\nAll too often, adults get so caught up in working to pay the bills and keeping up with the \"Joneses\\'\" that they neglect to harness the fun in life; the fun that can be the reward of enjoying a relaxing game with another person. It has been said that \"man is that he might have joy\" but all too often we skate through life without much of it. Playing games allows us to: relax, learn something new and stimulating, interact with people on a different more comfortable level, and to enjoy non-threatening competition. For these reasons, adults should place a higher priority on playing games in their lives.'\n",
            " 'Games are a form of play that have been enjoyed by people of all ages for centuries. While they are often associated with children, games can also be an important source of entertainment and relaxation for adults. In this essay, I will argue that games are just as important for adults as they are for children and provide specific reasons and examples to support my position.\\nFirst, games can provide adults with an opportunity to relax and unwind after a long day. Work and other responsibilities can be stressful, and taking a break to play a game can be a great way to de-stress and clear the mind. For example, a game of chess or a puzzle can provide a mental challenge that allows the player to focus on something other than their daily concerns. This can help to reduce anxiety and improve overall well-being.\\nSecond, games can also be a great way for adults to socialize and connect with others. Many games are designed to be played with friends or family, and participating in these activities can provide a sense of connection and community. For example, a weekly game night with friends can be a fun and enjoyable way to spend time together and strengthen relationships.\\nThird, games can also have educational value for adults. Many games require players to think critically and problem-solve, which can help to improve cognitive skills such as critical thinking and decision-making. For example, a game of Scrabble can help adults improve their vocabulary and language skills, while a strategy game like Settlers of Catan can teach players about resource management and planning.\\nIn conclusion, games are as important for adults as they are for children. They provide an opportunity to relax and de-stress, connect with others, and even improve cognitive skills. Whether played casually with friends or more competitively in organized tournaments, games can be an enjoyable and valuable part of adult life.'\n",

For example, some people want to be to go on a further study after they graduate from the college; some people hope to find a good job after their studying in the college and also some people wish to exchange their present situation through studying in the college. In my opinion, no matter what reason people study in the college for, studying in the college is just a preparation for their future’ life.\\nFirst of all, students can learn new knowledge and experiences from the studying in the college. There are many teachers, professors with abundant teaching experience who teach students lots of new knowledge and help them to solve the problems in their study. With their help, student can learn a lot of useful basic and professional knowledge which is very helpful for their future’ work and study. After they finish their study in the college, students go to work in the society and contribute to the different fields.\\nSecondly, students can learn how to arrange their own time reasonably. Before their studying in college, their life often arranged by their parents and their study often arranged by their teachers. It is very different for them to live and study in college, because students studying in college have to arrange their life and study by themselves. They have right to arrange their part time, such as when to get up, when is the sport-time, when to finish the assignment etc. This is very important experience for students’ work and life in the future.\\nThirdly, studying in the college make students having opportunity to live with other student and learn how to cooperate with other people. Usually, people often have uncomfortable feeling to live with a stranger, because they do not know each other and perhaps their habit and personality are different. But for the long run, it is good for them. They have to cooperate with each other and solve a lot of problems they will face together. Gradually, they can learn how to care and understand other people. It is a preparation for students to go to cooperate with other people in the society.\\nAll in all, students not only can learn lots of new knowledge from the books but also can learn much more necessary experience such as how to arrange time and how to cooperate with other people. It is very important for their future work and life.'\n",

            " \"First impressions can often be influential in how we perceive and interact with others. Some people trust their initial assessments of a person's character because they believe these judgments are generally correct. On the other hand, others do not judge a person's character quickly because they believe first impressions are often wrong. In this essay, I will compare these two attitudes and explain why I agree with the latter.\\nOne argument in favor of trusting first impressions is that they are based on our instincts and intuition, which can be finely tuned through experience and exposure to different people and situations. These instincts and intuitions may be able to pick up on subtle cues and behaviors that reveal a person's true character, even if they are trying to put up a front or present a false image. For example, if we meet someone who is friendly and warm, we may instinctively trust them and feel comfortable around them, even if we do not know them well.\\nHowever, relying solely on first impressions can also lead to biases and prejudices that may not be accurate or fair. People are complex and multifaceted, and it is difficult to fully understand their character based on a few initial interactions. Furthermore, first impressions are often influenced by societal norms, expectations, and stereotypes, which can distort our perceptions and lead us to make judgments that are not based on reality.\\nFor example, if we meet someone who is dressed in a certain way or has a particular accent, we may automatically assume certain things about their character based on these superficial characteristics. This can lead to misunderstandings and prejudices that prevent us from getting to know someone truly and forming a genuine connection with them.\\nIn my opinion, the best approach is to not judge a person's character quickly and instead take the time to get to know them before forming an opinion. This allows us to see the full range of their personality and characteristics and make a more informed and balanced assessment of their character.\\nOf course, this does not mean that we should blindly trust everyone we meet and ignore any red flags or warning signs. It simply means that we should approach people with an open mind and be willing to give them the benefit of the doubt until we have sufficient evidence to the contrary.\\nIn conclusion, while trusting first impressions may be tempting, relying solely on them can lead to biases and prejudices that are not accurate or fair. A more balanced and nuanced approach is to not judge a person's character quickly and instead take the time to get to know them before forming an opinion. This allows us to see the full range of their personality and characteristics and make a more informed and balanced assessment of their character.\"\n",

And life conditions are getting worse every day. I think that companies can do a lot of things about that. They can even raise their profits helping the society. Recently, I read in a newspaper about a complaint of McDonalds to plant trees in order to prevent further destruction of the ozone layer.

Many companies can make an effort and use special equipment in their product ional process in order to restrict the air pollution.\\nIn conclusion, I think that the company is better to give some money to protect the environment, because in this way it will benefit the whole society.

Some people are attracted to dangerous sports or other dangerous activities such as mountain climbing, car racing and high speed skiing to mention but a few, for a variety of reasons\\nFor some, it is a challenge to be overcome or won. An example is a lady driver joining the rally. For example in Kenya, we have an annual Safari rally, which involves cars racing with an aim of finishing with best points. The terrain is usually very varied and rough and men dominate the sport. Recently, there have been entries by women, and some may participate to prove that women can also undertake the challenge and it should not be seen as a man's race.\\nOther sportsmen and women may find these dangerous activities to be actually fun. For some mountain climbers for example, the goal is not only to reach the peak but also to enjoy the varying scenario, plants and animals as they ascend the mountain.\\nTo others still, the attraction could be the prize to be won in participating in such a dangerous sport. An example is in bullfights where the player dangles a red cloth in front of a bull, not only irritating it but also inciting the animal to charge. If the player wins defeats the bull, he is allowed to kill and probably earn some money.\\nIn conclusion therefore, there are varying reasons that attract some people to dangerous sports, ranging from the personal to monitory satisfaction.\"\n",

After the whole house has been declared “clear,” I start to breathe normally again and a smile appears on my face as I realize, once again, how a simple movie seen at the cinema a week earlier can modify my actions.\\nSometimes I wonder if I should watch TV, with all its shows that make me wonder whether I exercise enough, whether I am slim enough, or whether I treat my pets with the care they deserve: am I really concerned about their mental health??? Not to mention the hundreds of commercials that try to make me believe I need a water purifier to remain alive since the water I am currently drinking is heavily polluted!

My husband and I were in a restaurant when I heard my young neighbor pronouncing violent words in a low angry voice. Surprised, I turned to better understand the situation and I saw that he was holding a fake military device and was acting as if he were filming a war movie. I am sure that if I had been a little be more updated about this type of movie, I would have recognized what he was saying as a quotation. Now, I wonder if he uses such a language also with his friends and with his parents, if he is aggressive, and if so, whether his attitude has really nothing to do with what he watches on TV.\\nThat same evening on the way home I saw two cars stopped one next to the other at a traffic light and as soon as the light turned green they started racing, in the middle of town. In this case not even a major knowledge of movies and TV programs would have helped me: there are just to many of them on the market showing the exact same thing: people racing with cars.\\nI am sure that everybody, if asked, could easily list many other examples of how TV and movies can modify our behavior and therefore our life but, I wonder, if we will always be able to draw the line between a TV show and real life, between what they make us think we want and what instead we really need and are and believe.'\n",

While it may be tempting to hire an inexperienced worker at a lower salary, there are several reasons why I believe that the benefits of hiring an experienced worker outweigh the initial cost.\\nFirst and foremost, experienced workers have a proven track record of success in their field. They have already demonstrated their skills and abilities through previous work experiences, which means that they are more likely to be effective in their new role. In contrast, inexperienced workers may require significant training and supervision in order to reach the same level of productivity.

May be parents should pay less money? A lot of parents think like this. But I disagree with the statement that teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn.\\nI think that everything depends on a student and his willingness to study. So why should teachers be paid according to students desire? Teachers help us to understand a lot of things from the books if we cannot afford them. And if students do not want to study, why should teachers suffer?\\nTeachers have been studying for many years. They became teachers through so many difficulties and efforts. As far as I know if you want to be a teacher you have to study a lot. You have to get very good education, because you will take responsibility for the rest of your life-to teach others since you have finished the education. That means that the teachers spent a lot of time, energy to get their degree. And I think that they have already deserved to be well paid.\\nPeople were always paid for their knowledge. As much as you know, as much as you are awarded. I think that teachers know a lot, in such a way they should be paid well for their knowledge. And it does not depend on how much their students learnt. I think that there is no bad teachers- there are only bad students. And if the student explains lack of his knowledge because of a teacher that means that he never tried. He never tried to study; he never tried to ask his teacher for help, he never wanted to get more than his laziness.\\nThat's why I think that teachers should not be paid according to how much their students learn.

Books that are based on true events can provide insight into historical or current events and give a deeper understanding of the world around us. Similarly, biographies and non-fiction works can offer a glimpse into the lives and experiences of real people and can be inspiring or thought-provoking. Reading books that are based on established facts can also help us learn new things and expand our knowledge base.\\nOn the other hand, there are also valid arguments against this statement. Fiction, for example, can be just as educational and informative as non-fiction. Many fictional works are based on real events or are inspired by real people, but they often take creative liberties in order to tell a compelling story. Additionally, fiction can be a powerful tool for exploring and examining complex ideas, emotions, and social issues in a way that is not always possible with non-fiction. Fiction can also serve as a means of escapism and entertainment, which can be important for mental health and well-being.\\nIn conclusion, whether or not people should read only books that are about real events, real people, and established facts is a matter of personal preference and depends on an individual\\'s goals and interests. While there are certainly benefits to reading non-fiction and books based on real events, there are also many benefits to reading fiction and other imaginative works.

By doing this I will make my organization more cost effective, as for building and construction purpose, more numbers of workers are required, and this helps cutting down expenses. Also, when the work is related to the physical work, then more than experience, the desire to work counts. If the person is inexperienced, then he can learn how to work, until he has desired to work.

The total amount of the salary the worker gets by the completion of work is almost same whether the worker is experienced or inexperienced. Training is required for an inexperienced worker and the training expenses can be more. But for the experienced worker, training is not required, one can just understand by observing, and managing oneself. The experienced one can get the job done soon while, the inexperienced worker takes double the time. Double the time means double the salary one gets. So, whether one is experienced or not, total amount of the salary, the employer has to pay is somewhat equivalent. Organization values its overall human resources, no matter whomever; all are integral part for its existence. For the long-term development and for the Excellency, experienced worker needs to be hired.\\nI work in the international organization that deals with the e-consultation. If the inexperienced person was hired for the same job, then he would almost take 6 months to understand what’s going on. But if the person is experienced one, he needs not more than one month to get involved. For such an organization, Excellency is of prior than the amount of salary that is to be paid. Also, it’s not sure that even after training, the inexperienced person can work effectively. In the medical shop, if I have to hire the sales man than, I would go for the experienced one even at the higher salary. Experience is the most important criteria for employing as the work is relates to the health of many people.\\nSo in my point of view, experienced workers are more effective than inexperienced ones regardless of the amount.'\n",
            " \"A good neighbor is an important part of any community. They can make a neighborhood a pleasant and welcoming place to live, and can also be a source of support and friendship during difficult times. In my opinion, there are several key qualities that make someone a good neighbor.\\nFirst, a good neighbor is considerate of others. This means being mindful of the noise level, being respectful of other people's property, and being willing to lend a helping hand when needed. For example, a good neighbor might offer to watch someone's pets while they are away, or help shovel snow from a driveway during a winter storm.\\nSecond, a good neighbor is open to communication and willing to listen. This means being willing to have honest and respectful conversations about any issues or concerns that may arise. It also means being open to hearing different viewpoints and being willing to find common ground and work towards a resolution.\\nThird, a good neighbor is dependable and trustworthy. This means being reliable and sticking to commitments, such as agreeing to watch someone's house while they are away or taking care of a shared piece of property. It also means being willing to keep confidences and respect the privacy of others.\\nFourth, a good neighbor is inclusive and welcoming. This means being open to getting to know their neighbors and making an effort to build positive relationships. This could involve inviting people over for dinner, hosting a neighborhood barbecue, or simply saying hello and asking how someone's day is going.\\nOverall, a good neighbor is someone who is considerate, open to communication, dependable, and inclusive. These qualities not only help to create a harmonious and enjoyable community, but also foster a sense of belonging and connection with others.\"\n",
            " 'In some countries, it is common for teenagers to have jobs while they are still students. There are both pros and cons to this arrangement, and ultimately it depends on the individual circumstances of the teenager and their ability to balance work and school commitments.\\nOne potential benefit of having a job while in school is that it can provide teenagers with valuable work experience and skills. This can help them to develop a strong resume and stand out to future employers, as well as giving them a sense of responsibility and independence. Working while in school can also be a good source of income for teenagers, allowing them to pay for their own expenses or save up for the future.\\nHowever, there are also potential drawbacks to working while in school. Depending on the number of hours worked and the demands of the job, it can be difficult for teenagers to balance their schoolwork and their job responsibilities. This can lead to reduced academic performance, as well as increased stress and fatigue. Additionally, if a teenager is working a significant number of hours, they may have less time for extracurricular activities, socializing, and other important aspects of their personal development.\\nOverall, whether it is a good idea for teenagers to have jobs while they are still students depends on the individual circumstances of each teenager and their ability to manage their time and responsibilities effectively. It can be a valuable opportunity for personal and professional growth, but it is important to consider the potential impact on academics and overall well-being.'\n",
            " \"There is a longstanding debate about whether universities should allocate the same amount of funding to student sports activities as they do to university libraries. In this essay, I will argue that while both sports activities and libraries are important for the university community, universities should prioritize funding for libraries over sports activities.\\nFirst and foremost, libraries are an integral part of a university's academic mission. They provide a wealth of knowledge and resources that students, faculty, and staff can access to support their research, learning, and teaching. Libraries often have large collections of books, journals, and other materials that cover a wide range of subjects and disciplines. In addition to traditional print materials, many libraries also offer access to electronic resources such as databases and e-books. These resources are essential for students to complete their coursework and for faculty to conduct research.\\nIn contrast, sports activities, while important for physical health and well-being, are not directly related to the university's academic mission. While sports teams may provide opportunities for students to engage in physical activity and build teamwork skills, they are not essential to the educational process in the same way that libraries are.\\nFurthermore, university sports programs often require a significant amount of funding to support facilities, equipment, and coaching staff. This can be especially costly for large, Division I programs that compete at the highest level. Allocating a large portion of the university's budget to sports activities could potentially divert funding away from other areas, such as libraries and academic programs, that are more closely tied to the university's educational mission.\\nAdditionally, while sports activities may be popular and generate revenue through ticket sales and merchandise, they are not necessarily the most financially stable source of funding for the university. In contrast, libraries can generate revenue through grants and donations, and may also be able to secure funding from external sources such as foundations and government agencies.\\nIn conclusion, while sports activities are important for the well-being and engagement of the university community, universities should prioritize funding for libraries over sports activities. Libraries play a vital role in supporting the academic mission of the university and provide essential resources for research, learning, and teaching. Allocating a significant portion of the university's budget to sports activities could potentially divert funding away from other areas that are more closely tied to the university's educational mission.\"\n",

There are several specific reasons why I would choose to meet Leonardo da Vinci, and I will outline a few of them here.\\nFirst and foremost, I would like to meet Leonardo da Vinci because he was an incredibly accomplished and influential figure in history. He was not only a brilliant artist, but also a scientist, inventor, and engineer. His contributions to the fields of anatomy, engineering, and architecture were groundbreaking, and his works of art, such as the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, are still considered some of the greatest masterpieces of all time.\\nAnother reason I would like to meet Leonardo da Vinci is because of his curious and inquisitive nature. He was known to be constantly asking questions and seeking out new knowledge, which is something that I greatly admire. I believe that this curiosity and desire to learn is what allowed him to make such significant contributions to so many different fields.\\nFinally, I would like to meet Leonardo da Vinci because I believe that I could learn a lot from him. As someone who is deeply interested in science, art, and innovation, I believe that I could gain a lot of valuable insights and inspiration from someone like Leonardo da Vinci. I believe that his unique perspective and way of thinking would be incredibly valuable to me, and I would be eager to learn as much as I could from him.\\nOverall, if I could travel back in time to meet a famous person from history, I would choose to meet Leonardo da Vinci. His numerous accomplishments and contributions, his curious and inquisitive nature, and his unique perspective and way of thinking all make him an ideal choice for someone like me who is interested in learning and growing.'\n",

I personally consider that \"never give up\" is not only good but is also appropriate attitude to life in order to succeed in this cruel world. In my opinion everybody must never give up himself when follows his aims. Even he has not achieved them he has to try again. Maybe next time he will succeed. I have always believed that this is the best way to survive. I will give you arguments to support my opinion.\\nFirst of all I think you have to trust yourself, realize your targets one by one, and never to give up in every difficult moment. People always have to put aims to their selves and follow them. When they achieve one aim they are satisfied of this success and put another aim to be reached. This is the man\\'s nature. If you give up at the first problem you will lose belief in yourself and will reach nothing.\\nOn the second place I would like to say that even if you fail you achieve much. Everybody knows that sometimes you cannot complete or even realize your goals because of the environment. I believe that you do not have to give up at first bad shot; you have to try again and again until you succeed. From the failures you learn how to proceed next time and revise your actions in order to thrive. I bet finally you will.\\nLast but not least \"never give up\" is the best way to survive in these days. If you do not have aims to achieve you are nothing. Your life will pass unnoticeably and you will be insignificant person that nobody sees. Many people around us always give us examples of never to give up. Ballet-dancers who were fractured their legs and with a lot of efforts manage to dance again because this is their main purpose. Deaf-and-dump people learn to communicate with gestures with the others. Thus give meaning of their lives. Undoubtedly reaching these targets is very hard but they never give up and they survive.\\nFrom the argument I have stated above it can be seen that no matter how difficult it is to realize your aims you have to never give up and this is the best attitude to life.'\n",

As for me, I personally prefer to construct the agriculture research center in my country, China. There are two reasons for my position; the agriculture is very important to my country and the less young people like to work in the agriculture.\\nFirst of all, the agriculture is very important for my country. The large population cause my country to have the problem that there are still lots of people cannot eat enough food. If we do not improve our country's agriculture technology, it will be hard to resolve the food problem. So building the agriculture research center can offer us more information about the development technology and help us to produce more food. We can learn lots of other developed country's advantages through researching and use this information to advance our country's agriculture. Thus, the agriculture research center can give us many benefits.\\nAnother reason is that the young people begin to ignore the agriculture in my country. They do not like to study agriculture, because they think they cannot earn a lot of money by learning agriculture. The flourishing business attracts them. Especially in villages, everybody wants to work in the city, and nobody care the corps. It causes only the old experts continue to study the agriculture, no new persons can help them to think the problems. The old experts have limited knowledge. They are hard to get the new things. If more young persons can be volunteers to work for agriculture, more problems will be resolved quickly. There, the young people need to realize the importance of agriculture, because they can make more profits in agriculture.\\nIn short, people have different perspectives on building a business center or an agriculture center. However, I am convinced that we need to build the agriculture center. Following my country's situation, the question that whether the people can eat enough or not is the most important things. Therefore, the ignorance of agriculture will make our country go to the famine country.\"\n",
            " 'Some people believe that a college or a university should be available to all students. Others think that higher education should be available only to good students. In my opinion, higher education should be available to all students. Why do I think so?\\nFirstly, to get higher education is a right of any person. If higher education is available only to good student, it will be infringement of human rights. We cannot say to man that she or he is not entitled to get higher education because it will be anti-constitutional. On the other hand, a college or university can have own rules for students who don\\'t have a good GPA. For example, students can graduate from college if they have only \"A\" or \"B\". Another example, students can take several times the same exam while they won’t receive a good grade. It is very important to give a right to get higher education to all students, because it will be their chance to change something in their life, get better job in the future or built their career.\\nSecondly, who gives us right to share people in good and bad students. Maybe they have good abilities for studying, yet, these students chose the wrong way ignoring learning when they were high school students. We have a lot of examples when people didn\\'t have a good grade when they were a high school students, however, they could graduate from college and became to work successfully. We know many examples about great people, Pushkin, Mendeleev, who weren\\'t good students in all subjects, but they were very talented persons and whole world knows their names. To be a good or bad students are not the same to have abilities for learning. We should understand and remember it.\\nSome people can say that government and parents just waste money for education bad students. Nonetheless, the government also can change rules for those students. For example, not support financially if the student has a grade \"C\" or worse. However, our government sustains any students. I think that it is the right way, because we live in a free country and any man has the same right to get higher education. In summary, in spite of colleges and universities are mostly interested in good students, I strongly believe that any students, good or bad, should have the same right to earn high education.'\n",
            " \"It is a common saying that one should never judge a person by their external appearances. While it is true that people should not be judged solely based on their physical appearance, it is also important to recognize that external appearances can sometimes provide valuable information about a person. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of this argument and provide specific reasons and details to support my conclusion.\\nOn the one hand, it is wrong to judge a person solely based on their external appearances. There are countless examples of people who are judged unfairly based on their physical appearance, whether it be due to their race, ethnicity, gender, or other physical attributes. This type of judgment is not only unfair, but it also ignores the fact that people are complex individuals with unique experiences and perspectives.\\nFor example, a person who is judged based on their appearance may be unfairly assumed to be lazy or unintelligent simply because they do not present themselves in a certain way. This type of judgment ignores the fact that people have different personal styles and may not prioritize certain aspects of their appearance. Additionally, external appearances do not always accurately reflect a person's character or abilities. A person who appears confident and put-together may actually be struggling with self-esteem issues, while a person who appears shy and unassuming may have a wealth of knowledge and experience.\\nOn the other hand, it is also important to recognize that external appearances can sometimes provide valuable information about a person. For example, if a person is dressed in a uniform or is wearing a name tag, it is reasonable to assume that they are affiliated with a particular organization or profession. Similarly, if a person is wearing clothing or accessories that convey a certain message, it is reasonable to assume that they are trying to communicate something about themselves.\\nIn conclusion, while it is wrong to judge a person solely based on their external appearances, it is also important to recognize that external appearances can provide valuable information about a person. It is important to consider both the potential biases and limitations of judging people based on their appearance, as well as the potential insights that external appearances can provide.\"\n",
            " \"It is generally accepted that people behave differently when they wear different clothes. This belief is supported by numerous studies and personal observations, which suggest that clothing can have a significant impact on an individual's behavior and attitude.\\nOne example of this can be seen in the way people dress for work. Many people tend to dress more formally for the office, wearing suits and dresses, and this can often lead to a shift in their behavior. They may feel more professional and serious in their work attire, leading to a more formal and business-like demeanor. On the other hand, when people dress more casually, such as in jeans and a t-shirt, they may feel more relaxed and informal, leading to a more casual and laid-back behavior.\\nAnother example can be seen in the way people behave when they are participating in different activities or events. For instance, when people attend a formal event, such as a wedding or a black-tie affair, they often dress in formal attire, such as a tuxedo or a formal gown. This can lead to a change in their behavior, as they may feel more sophisticated and refined in their formal attire, leading to a more poised and elegant demeanor. On the other hand, when people attend a more casual event, such as a barbecue or a beach party, they may dress in more casual clothing, such as shorts and a tank top. This can lead to a more relaxed and laid-back behavior, as they feel more comfortable in their casual attire.\\nIn conclusion, it is clear that clothing can influence the way people behave. Whether it is the formal attire of a business setting or the casual clothing of a relaxed event, the clothes we wear can have a significant impact on our behavior and attitude. It is important to consider the impact of clothing on our behavior and to choose our attire appropriately for the situation at hand.\"\n",
            " 'I support the view that teachers should be a part of the learning process. Below are several beneficial reasons for which I feel that teachers are needed in while learning. Below are also some of the problems that come up without their presence.\\nPrimarily teachers are there for guidance in a particular field or subject. They give you a systematic and better way to approach a subject. A teacher normally teaches a subject in which he or she has expertise. Hence that person has made a study of the subject and can guide you in order to help you approach the subject in a better way. This guidance may be in the form of giving you names of reference books or giving you notes. Without a teacher it would be extremely cumbersome to go through large libraries for a certain topic. Besides this the teacher could provide you help with any sort of problem that you come across while studying. The teacher could provide you strategies that help you solve a problem. Without a teacher, this problem would take up a lot of your valuable time or remain unsolved. Teachers can also point out when you are going wrong. They point out our mistakes and suggest ways for us to correct them.\\nIn the end it does depend on the individual person to finally getting down to learn a subject. The actual studying has to be done by the individual. But the learning process can be made much simpler with the proper and continuous guidance of teachers. Hence it betters to learn with the help of a teacher rather than learning by you.'\n",

While intelligence and a sense of humor can certainly enhance a friendship, I value reliability because it is the foundation upon which all other aspects of a friendship can be built.\\nHaving a reliable friend means that I can count on them to be there for me when I need them. Whether I need a shoulder to cry on, someone to confide in, or just someone to hang out with, a reliable friend will be there for me. In contrast, a friend who is not reliable may not be there when I need them, which can leave me feeling isolated and unsupported.\\nOne specific example of the importance of reliability in a friendship is when I was going through a difficult time in my life. I was struggling with depression and had a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. One of my friends, who was reliable, would check in on me every day and encourage me to get out of bed and get dressed. This small act of kindness made a huge difference in my life and helped me get through a tough time.\\nIn contrast, I have had experiences with friends who were not reliable and it has caused problems in the friendship. For example, I had a friend who would make plans with me and then cancel last minute, or who would promise to help me with something and then not follow through. These experiences left me feeling frustrated and let down, and ultimately caused a strain in the friendship.\\nIn conclusion, while intelligence and a sense of humor are certainly valuable qualities in a friend, I believe that reliability is the most important characteristic. Having a reliable friend means that I can count on them to be there for me when I need them, and this is something that is invaluable to me.'\n",
            " 'Both the ability to work with a group of people on a team and to work independently are important skills to have in the modern world. However, the importance of one skill over the other may depend on the specific task or situation at hand.\\nOne reason why the ability to work with a team is important is that it allows for greater collaboration and the sharing of diverse perspectives and skills. Working on a team allows individuals to pool their knowledge and resources, which can lead to more efficient and effective problem-solving. For example, a team of engineers may be able to design a more innovative and functional product if they are able to collaborate and bounce ideas off of each other.\\nAdditionally, the ability to work with a team can be especially important in a professional setting, where it is often necessary to work with others to complete projects and meet deadlines. Strong teamwork skills can help to foster a positive and productive work environment, which can lead to better outcomes for the organization.\\nOn the other hand, there are also situations where it is more important to be able to work independently. For example, if an individual is working on a task that requires a high level of focus and concentration, they may prefer to work alone to minimize distractions. Additionally, some tasks may require a high degree of independence and self-motivation, such as when working on a solo project or when completing a task with little supervision.\\nIn conclusion, both the ability to work with a team and to work independently are important skills to have. The relative importance of these skills may depend on the specific task or situation at hand, and it is often useful to be able to adapt and switch between these two modes of working as needed.'\n",
            " \"Sports have always been an unseperatable part of a schoolchild's life. But does it really do so much good after all? This is the topic we are going to talk about today.\\nFirst of all advantages, the most obvious one is probably the effect a moderate amount of exercise has on the child. Experience shows that children who exercise regularly are more attentive in class than children who never exercise. I remember that I felt a lot more concentrated in class when I was in fourth grade, when I was in a soccer team, than in fifth grade, when I dropped out and stopped exercising entirely. Exercise also has effects on a child's confidence, both in the means of shaping the child's body and giving the child a competition-conscious mind. For example, one of my best friends spent a lot of time on track when she was in primary school, ending up being among the tallest girls in school and having a somewhat superior feeling being able to run faster than anyone else.\\nBut too much sport or improper guidance can be harmful. Being too involved usually ends up in the child feeling tired all the time or taking up too much time that was originally meant for study or play. Children can easily get too worked up in competitions and if this goes without steering, the child may develop wrong views towards winning and losing and life in general. It may also be harmful towards a child's body. Gymnastics, for instance, is known to be harsh towards the gymnasts, usually ending them up small and short. Many sports are dangerous, and children may be crippled when injured in the course of game.\\nSo what attitude should we take up when we are facing such a question? As I see it, children's sports, despite the dangers, should be supported. After all, a moderate amount of sport is essential for a healthy child, and really getting involved in a sport can help build a child's reflexes, skills in sports in general, not to say the understanding of teamwork. So, spending lots of time on sports should be a good sign for young children. It means that these children are learning young what they will need to know all their lives.\"\n",

Of course, doing homework will scare our leisure time in some extent, but it can help students understand the texts more deeply, force students to review the texts and make students have a lasting impression about the texts. So personally, I would prefer to do homework everyday.\\nThere are numerous reasons why I think that daily homework is necessary for students, and I would here explain some of the most important ones. The main reason is daily homework can help students understand the texts more deeply. It can be given an example; you must make yourself understand the texts firstly in order to do your homework. Whatever in mathematics, in chemistry or other courses, if you don't understand the texts, you cannot finish the homework of that day.\\nThe other reason is that daily homework can force the students to review the texts. Just imagine when you have the problems in your homework you will understand it more. When you have the problems, what can make you work out is reading your texts and your notes carefully or discussing with other students.\\nOne very strong argument is that doing homework can make the students have a lasting impression about the texts. In order to see it clearly, let us see an example. When students do their homework, they have to review the texts, understand the texts; even more discuss the problems about the texts. They gradually have a lasting impression about the texts.\\nFrom what has been discussed above, doing homework has more advantages, so we finally draw the conclusion that daily homework is necessary for students.\"\n",

It stands tall in the New York harbor, welcoming immigrants and visitors alike to our shores. The statue represents the ideals of freedom, liberty, and equality that have long been associated with the United States.\\nOne of the reasons I would choose the Statue of Liberty to represent my country is that it symbolizes our commitment to freedom and democracy.

            " \"Telephones and email have certainly revolutionized the way we communicate with one another, but whether or not they have made communication less personal is a matter of debate.\\nOn one hand, it could be argued that telephones and email have made communication more convenient and efficient. With just a phone call or an email, we can instantly reach someone anywhere in the world, at any time of day. We no longer have to wait for letters to be delivered or make long journeys to visit someone in person. This has made it easier to stay in touch with friends and family, even when we are physically apart.\\nHowever, some people argue that the convenience of telephones and email has led to a decrease in face-to-face communication and a corresponding loss of personal connection. It is true that we are now more likely to communicate with others through a screen or over the phone, rather than in person. This can make it harder to pick up on nonverbal cues and can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.\\nAdditionally, the impersonal nature of email and text messaging can make it easier for people to be rude or insensitive in their communication. Without the social cues of in-person interactions, it can be harder to gauge the tone of a message and people may be more likely to say things they wouldn't say in person.\\nOverall, while telephones and email have certainly made communication more convenient, they have also had some negative effects on the personal nature of communication. It is important to strike a balance and make an effort to have in-person interactions, as well as using technology to stay connected.\"\n",

Sometimes the clothes we chose express our mood, how we are feeling at that moment. Also, the hairstyle, make up and many other aspects of our look sometimes give an idea of our attitude towards life. Even though, not all aspects or, for some people, any aspect of the personality is shown in external appearances. The look is not evident enough to communicate deep feelings, beliefs, thoughts and behaviors. There is so much more inside of a person that can only be noticed after knowing him very well.\\nI have met people who give an erroneous first impression. At first sight one could describe them in a completely different way from what they turn to be when you get to know them well. Before making premature conclusions we should pay attention at many other features, such as the way the person talks, the words he uses, the look in his eyes that help us to recognize how is that person like. People’s values, educational background, skills and virtues lie in the inside, not in the outside.\\nThere is a great risk of missing good friends if we allow us to judge by appearances. We always should give a second chance to people to show us how they really are, without masquerades. We have to be smart to not mistake what we see on the surface, because the main part of almost everything is hidden and not easily seen.'\n",
            " 'The family and friends both play important roles in the development of young adults and can influence their decisions and behaviors in different ways. While some may argue that the family is the most important influence, others may believe that friends have a greater impact. In my opinion, both the family and friends can be equally important influences on young adults, depending on the individual and the specific circumstances.\\nOn one hand, the family can have a strong influence on young adults due to the close relationship and frequent interactions with family members. Families often provide a sense of belonging, support, and guidance to their children as they navigate the challenges of adolescence and young adulthood. For example, a young adult who has a close relationship with their parents may be more likely to seek their advice and guidance when making important decisions, such as choosing a career or deciding whether to attend college.\\nAdditionally, the values, beliefs, and behaviors of the family can also have a lasting impact on young adults. For instance, a young adult who grows up in a household where education is valued may be more likely to prioritize their academic pursuits and pursue higher education. On the other hand, a young adult who grows up in a household where substance abuse is prevalent may be more likely to engage in risky behaviors and suffer negative consequences as a result.\\nOn the other hand, friends can also be a significant influence on young adults. Friends often serve as a source of social support, companionship, and identity formation during this developmental stage. For example, a young adult who has a group of supportive friends may feel more confident and secure in their identity, while a young adult who lacks supportive friends may feel isolated and vulnerable.\\nFurthermore, friends can also expose young adults to new experiences, ideas, and perspectives that may shape their beliefs and behaviors. For instance, a young adult who has friends with diverse backgrounds and interests may be more open-minded and open to new experiences, while a young adult who only associates with a narrow group of friends may be less exposed to diversity and new ideas.\\nIn conclusion, both the family and friends can be important influences on young adults, and the impact of each can vary depending on the individual and the specific circumstances. While the family may provide a sense of belonging, support, and guidance, friends can serve as a source of social support, companionship, and exposure to new ideas and experiences. Ultimately, the influence of both the family and friends can be crucial in shaping the development of young adults as they transition into adulthood.'\n",

On the other hand, a lower-paying job with shorter hours would allow me to have more flexibility in my schedule, giving me the opportunity to spend quality time with my loved ones.\\nAnother reason I would choose a lower-paying job with shorter hours is because I believe that personal fulfillment and happiness are important aspects of a successful and fulfilling career. While a high-paying job may bring financial success, it may not necessarily bring happiness or personal fulfillment if it requires sacrificing time with loved ones or pursuing interests outside of work. On the other hand, a lower-paying job with shorter hours would allow me to pursue my passions and interests outside of work, and would also allow me to have a better work-life balance, which could lead to greater overall satisfaction and happiness.\\nIn conclusion, while a high-paying job may bring financial security and stability, I believe that the benefits of a lower-paying job with shorter hours, such as more time with family and friends and greater personal fulfillment, outweigh the potential financial sacrifices. Ultimately, the choice between a high-paying job with long hours and a lower-paying job with shorter hours depends on an individual's priorities and values.\"\n",
            " 'Some people prefer to live in places that have the same weather or climate all year long. Others like to live in areas where the weather changes several times a year. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.\\nI was born in a part of the world where the climate has four seasons and I learnt how much beauty each of these periods can bring to the environments and our lives. I prefer to live in an area where the weather changes several times a year.\\nAlthough sometimes I experience difficulties in the cold winters because of my bad tolerance to low temperatures, I cannot imagine the Christmas without the white snow making the whole world to look like the pictures from a fairy tale book. There is so much beauty that each season comes with that I do not think I can live in a place where the climate is the same all year long. I might like going in those places for some weeks in winter but not for a longer time. If I were to live in such a place for a life- time, I would miss the spring when the whole nature wakes up. I would miss all the wonderful spring colors, the new buds, the first grass that comes after the gray winter, the trees blooming, and the birds that are coming back from warmer places where they lived during winter.\\nThe spring is my favorite season, but I love and know to cherish the others as well. Talking about colors, the fall is the next on my list, with all those reddish, yellowish and brownish hues that cover both the leaves and the earth. The ripe harvests, the crops waiting to be gathered are things that bring joy and satisfaction in fall.\\nThe summer has its own beauty and in that period of the year the holiday flavor is in the air. In places with temperate climate the vegetation is abundant. The days are sunny and bright.\\nLiving in a place with the same climate all year around would be very difficult, as I could not enjoy and cherish the wonderful things that occur every time a new season arrive.'\n",
            " \"If I had to travel to a place 40 miles away, I would consider several ways of transportation, such as car, bicycle, or train. Each of these options has its advantages and disadvantages. In this essay I will present advantages of each way of traveling, and I will argue in favor of traveling by train.\\nIt would be possible to travel by car. Cars are reasonably fast and comfortable. They can accommodate more than one passenger, which is important when several people travel together. Most cars are spacious, so every passenger has enough space to fully enjoy the trip. Moreover, passengers can travel as fast as it suits them. If they are in hurry or some kind of emergency situation, they can travel very quickly. On the other hand, if the purpose of their trip is casual, such as visit to a friend or having a picnic in the nature, they can make occasional stops, in order to rest or enjoy the pleasant surroundings. The driver requires some mental effort, because he has to pay attention to the traffic in front of him.\\nAnother option is traveling by bicycle, since 40 miles is not a very large distance. One important advantage of a bicycle is that it doesn't burn fuel in order to move, so it doesn't produce toxic output, which would pollute the environment. Moreover, bicycles are healthier than cars. Riding a bicycle requires physical effort and strengthens muscles. In fact, some scientist asserts that riding a bicycle is one of the most effective forms of exercise. Bicycles find their way through heavy traffic more quickly and easily than cars. Also, they use less space and are easier to park, which makes them useful for travels through heavily urbanized and crowded areas. Finally, bicycles are the cheapest conveyances, since they don't require expenses for fuel, and only minute amounts of money are needed for maintenance.\\nFor my part, I must argue in favor of traveling by train, because it comprises some of the main positive properties of both previously discussed approaches. Trains are very comfortable, and they don't require any effort from the passenger, neither physical, nor mental. They are also very fast, sometimes even faster than cars. Finally, trains are environmentally clean means of transportation, since they use electric power, not fossil fuels, like cars do. The superiority of traveling by train is further confirmed by the corresponding price, which is significantly higher than those of car or a bicycle travels.\"\n",
            " 'With the help of technology, students can learn more information and that too more quickly. This is absolutely correct. I would like to support my answer with some reasons.\\nFirst, technological learning is more interactive in its learning process than just sitting and reading a book or just listening to a lecture. For example the learning by the means of Computer technology is very interactive, today, and hence the growth is simultaneous.\\nSecond, using such kind of techniques, mind actually grows more and the person becomes an intellectual person with the passage of time.\\nThird, the traditional methods of learning like lectures given by teachers or notes given in books. Do not let the student become independent rather the student becomes more dependent due to the spoon-feeding being done to it.\\nFourth, the technological advances in different fields definitely give a lot of exposure to those who were earlier naive in this field of Technology.\\nLastly, human mind is such that it has the capacity to absorb more data if things are taught to him practically. Like if there is a model of an Electric Iron shown in the Book, which is explained by the teacher and the students are made to understand the working. The other way could be this that the children are shown a real Electric Iron as a model and then the working of its different parts is being explained. Definitely the grasping power will be more in the latter case. Therefore, in the end I would like to conclude my essay by saying that with the passage of time the demands and the necessities of the Time are changing too. So are the changes in the student’s mental level and the methods of teaching. Technological methods undoubtedly score higher than the traditional ones.'\n",
            " 'Advertising can definitely tell you a lot about a country. Advertising reflects the values, beliefs, and desires of the society in which it exists, and can offer insights into the culture, economy, and political climate of a particular nation.\\nOne way that advertising can tell you a lot about a country is through the products and services being advertised. For example, if a country has a strong agricultural industry, you may see a lot of advertisements for farm equipment or agricultural chemicals. On the other hand, if a country has a thriving tech industry, you may see a lot of ads for smartphones and other gadgets. By examining the types of products and services being advertised, you can get a sense of the industries and sectors that are driving the economy of a particular country.\\nAnother way that advertising can provide insight into a country is through the messages and themes that are emphasized in ads. For example, if you see a lot of ads that focus on family values, traditional gender roles, and a strong work ethic, this may indicate that these values are important to the society in question. On the other hand, if you see a lot of ads that focus on individualism, self-expression, and social justice, this may indicate that these values are more prominent in the culture of the country.\\nAdditionally, the way that advertising is regulated in a country can also tell you a lot about its society. For example, if a country has strict regulations on advertising to children, this may indicate a concern for protecting the well-being and innocence of young people. On the other hand, if a country has more lenient regulations on advertising, this may indicate a belief in the power of consumer choice and the importance of free market capitalism.\\nIn conclusion, advertising can definitely tell you a lot about a country. By examining the products and services being advertised, the messages and themes emphasized in ads, and the way that advertising is regulated, you can gain valuable insights into the values, beliefs, and desires of a particular society.'\n",
            " 'The question of whether governments should spend more money on improving roads and highways or on improving public transportation is a complex one that has generated a lot of debate. While there are compelling arguments to be made for both approaches, I believe that governments should prioritize spending on public transportation.\\nOne of the main reasons for this is that improving public transportation can have a number of positive impacts on society. For example, better public transportation can make it easier for people to get to work or school, which can help to increase productivity and improve economic growth. It can also provide people with more affordable and convenient travel options, which can help to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. Additionally, improved public transportation can help to promote social inclusion by providing access to opportunities for those who may not have access to a car or other private transportation.\\nAnother reason to prioritize spending on public transportation is that it can be more cost-effective than spending on roads and highways. While building new roads and highways can be expensive, public transportation systems can often be built and maintained at a lower cost. Additionally, public transportation systems can serve a larger number of people, which means that the cost per person can be lower than the cost of building and maintaining roads and highways.\\nFurthermore, investing in public transportation can also have long-term benefits for the environment. Public transportation systems typically produce lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions than private cars, which can help to combat climate change. Additionally, public transportation can help to reduce the need for car ownership, which can free up land for other uses and help to reduce urban sprawl.\\nOverall, I believe that governments should prioritize spending on improving public transportation over spending on improving roads and highways. While both approaches have their merits, public transportation has the potential to provide a range of benefits for society, including improved productivity, reduced traffic congestion, and a healthier environment.'\n",
            " 'There is no doubt that both knowledge gained from experience and knowledge gained from books are valuable and important sources of learning. However, it is important to recognize that each has its own unique strengths and limitations, and it is ultimately up to the individual to determine which is more important in a given context.\\nOne of the main advantages of knowledge gained from experience is that it is often more practical and applicable to real-world situations. When we learn through experience, we are able to directly apply what we have learned to the tasks and challenges we face in our daily lives. This can be especially valuable when it comes to learning hands-on skills, such as cooking, carpentry, or programming.\\nIn contrast, knowledge gained from books tends to be more theoretical and abstract. While books can certainly provide a wealth of information and insight, they are often removed from the immediate context in which we live and work. This can make it more difficult to apply the knowledge gained from books to our everyday lives, although it can also provide a broader and more comprehensive understanding of a subject.\\nAnother difference between knowledge gained from experience and knowledge gained from books is the way in which it is acquired. When we learn through experience, we typically do so through trial and error, making mistakes and correcting them as we go. This can be a slow and often frustrating process, but it allows us to develop a deep understanding of a subject and to learn from our mistakes. In contrast, knowledge gained from books is often more structured and linear, allowing us to absorb information at a faster pace.\\nIn my opinion, both knowledge gained from experience and knowledge gained from books are important and have their own unique value. Ultimately, the most important source of knowledge will depend on the individual and their needs and goals. For example, someone who is looking to learn a specific skill or trade may find that knowledge gained from experience is more important, while someone who is looking to gain a broad understanding of a particular subject may find that knowledge gained from books is more valuable.\\nUltimately, the key is to recognize the strengths and limitations of both sources of knowledge and to use them in a way that is most effective for the individual. Whether we are learning through experience or through books, it is important to be open to new ideas and to continue seeking out opportunities to learn and grow.'\n",

Moreover, taking classes in many subjects helps one to increase his knowledge and to achieve new levels of it.\\nOf course it is a free choice to attend many classes or to specialize in one subject. But I rather attend university that requires students to take classes in many subjects. Because I am still incapable of making my mind which particular subject to choose, and because it is really important for one to know a lot of things, not only in the realm of his interests, but out of their borders.'\n",
            " \"In my opinion, the most important characteristic a person can have to be successful in life is determination. Determination is the quality that allows an individual to stay focused and motivated, even in the face of challenges and setbacks. It is the driving force behind a person's ability to achieve their goals and achieve success.\\nOne of the key reasons why determination is so important is that it allows a person to persevere through difficult times and setbacks. When faced with obstacles, a determined person will not give up easily, but will instead find ways to overcome those challenges and keep moving forward. This can be especially important in achieving long-term goals, as it is rare for anyone to achieve success without facing any challenges along the way.\\nAnother reason why determination is so important is that it allows a person to stay focused on their goals, even when faced with distractions or tempting alternatives. A determined person will not be swayed by external factors or distractions, but will instead remain focused on their ultimate objectives. This focus and commitment can be essential in helping a person stay on track and achieve their goals.\\nI have personally experienced the power of determination in my own life. For example, when I was in college, I was determined to graduate with honors, even though it meant putting in extra hours of studying and taking on a heavier course load. Despite the challenges and setbacks I faced, I remained determined and ultimately achieved my goal.\\nIn conclusion, determination is the most important characteristic a person can have to be successful in life. It allows an individual to persevere through challenges and setbacks, stay focused on their goals, and achieve success.\"\n",

I would ask this question because Einstein is one of the most influential and renowned scientists of all time, and his work has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and the fundamental laws of nature.\\nThere are several specific reasons why I would ask Einstein this question. First and foremost, I am deeply interested in the history and origins of science, and I believe that learning about the motivations and experiences of influential figures like Einstein can provide valuable insights into the creative process of scientific discovery. Additionally, Einstein faced many obstacles throughout his career, including being ostracized by the scientific community and being forced to flee his native Germany due to his Jewish heritage. I would be curious to learn more about how he managed to overcome these challenges and continue to make significant contributions to science despite facing such adversity.\\nFurthermore, I believe that Einstein's answer to this question could provide valuable guidance and inspiration to aspiring scientists and anyone looking to pursue their passions and make a meaningful impact in their field.

Personally, I tend to fall more into the latter category and prefer to live life at a slower pace.\\nOne reason for this is that I find that rushing through life often leads to a feeling of stress and anxiousness. When we are constantly in a hurry, we may feel pressure to meet deadlines and achieve certain goals, which can be overwhelming. On the other hand, taking things at a slower pace allows us to be more present in each moment and to appreciate the small joys in life. It gives us the space to reflect on our experiences and to make more mindful choices.\\nAnother reason I prefer a slower pace is that it allows for a greater sense of connection with others. When we are constantly rushing from one place to the next, we may not have the time or energy to fully engage with the people around us. Taking things at a slower pace allows us to have more meaningful conversations and to build deeper relationships with those we care about.\\nOf course, there are times when it is necessary to move quickly and get things done, and I do not believe that one should always avoid a sense of urgency. However, I believe that it is important to find a balance between the fast-paced and the slower parts of life. By taking time to slow down and appreciate the present moment, we can find a greater sense of peace and fulfillment in our lives.'\n",

Personally, I prefer to spend most of my time with my amicable, warm-hearted companions. In this essay, I will explain my opinion by offering several reasons.\\nMy mom has always told me that intimate relationships with people are really important in one's life. A human being, in order to live a life without any regrets, needs another person to depend upon. It is a well-known maxim that every man has shortcomings. Through close friendships, a mortal experiences a variety of activities, and realizes one's shortcomings. At the same time, the person can make one's friend be aware of his/her faults. This mutual relationship will eventually result in mental development of two human beings.\\nAn amiable relationship is not only beneficial for the realization of each other's shortcomings but also for their happiness. My friends and I often play soccer or basketball when we meet. These activities that we do together will be cherished as good lifetime's memory. Thus, a pleasant comradeship can be the main producer of pure joy.\\nTherefore, a companionship is wholesome in a lot of ways.

In order to escape the stress due to work pressure people try out different ways to become stress free. These include reading, gardening, cycling, playing and many more things as per their choice. For me the best ways to escape stress are listening to music of your choice, going on a short trip and spending time with family. The reasons for the above choices are mentioned below.\\nFirstly, listening to good music is the best way to escape from stress as because it takes us into a different world. While listening to the sweetly composed tunes it makes us forget all the worldly worries. Also we can listen to music anywhere using portable systems. This helps us in avoiding stress whenever we feel so. Therefore I think listening music is an excellent way to avoid stress.\\nSecondly, going on a short trip refreshes us and helps us to escape stress. Whenever we go for such trips we just leave aside our daily routine and just try to relax. We enjoy doing things out of the daily schedule. So this change simply lifts our spirits and helps us to escape stress.\\nAlso whenever we spent time with our family, we talk our heart out to our loved ones, listen to their sweet thoughts and play like a child with the young ones.

However, whether that impact has been positive or negative is a matter of debate. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family, while others believe that it has actually enhanced it in certain ways.\\nOn the one hand, it is true that television can be a major distraction, particularly when it is used excessively. If people spend all of their free time watching television, they may have less time to engage in meaningful conversations and activities with their friends and family. Additionally, television can be a solitary activity, which can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection.\\nFurthermore, some argue that television promotes passive consumption rather than active communication. Rather than having conversations and interacting with each other, people may simply sit in front of the television and absorb whatever content is being presented to them. This can lead to a lack of critical thinking and the inability to engage in meaningful discussions with others.\\nHowever, it is also important to consider the ways in which television can enhance communication among friends and family. For example, many people use television as a way to bond and connect with each other. For example, families may watch a favorite TV show together and then have conversations about it afterwards. Additionally, television can serve as a way to initiate discussions about important issues or to spark conversations about shared interests.\\nIn conclusion, while it is true that television can be a distraction and can potentially promote passive consumption, it is not accurate to say that it has completely destroyed communication among friends and family. While it is important to be mindful of the time and energy we devote to television, it can also be a useful tool for connecting with others and fostering meaningful conversations.'\n",
            " \"I was born in a small, quiet and peaceful village. Like other children in the village, I hope that one day I will live in a big city. Because I think that it is better for children to grow up in a big city than in the countryside. There are many advantages when living in a big city.\\nFirstly, the infrastructure in big city is much better than in the countryside, so the life there is more convenient. There are many highways and long, big bridges, which make transportation easier. With so may transport means such as taxi, family car, bus, cycle... it is very easy for you to go anywhere at any time. Along busy streets are tall, beautiful buildings. They are hotels, restaurants, embassies, hospitals, schools, private village big schools, big hospitals equipped with modern facilities make the study and treating disease more effective. Living in big cities, children have good opportunities to learn in good schools and examine in good hospitals. In entertainment centre, there are many games to develop children' body including physical games and intellectual ones. Children can play there after hard periods in class. In big cities, telecommunications are also completed. Children can access with new technology easily. It's wonderful to live in big city. That's reason why I wanted to stay in my uncle's house in Hanoi, capital of Vietnam, when I visited her at the children' age.\\nSecondly, big cities are not only economic centers but also social, cultural ones of a country. People here are active, polite, and intelligent... They are always busy with their work. It's good for children to get acquainted with people like them. Children can learn more from life in big cities than in the countryside. The life is hard and difficult, so it's good to adapt to it when you are children. The life in city helps children to have beautiful dream and have chance to make these dream come true.\\nAlthough there are also disadvantages in big cities such as social evils, environmental pollution, and noise... living in big cities is still dream of many people. It is better for children to grow up in big cities and have weekends in the countryside enjoying fresh air than live in the countryside and rarely come to city. In brief, children can develop comprehensively when living in big city.\\n  \\n \"\n",
            " \"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of whether it is better to learn by oneself or with a teacher. Both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the best method for any given individual will depend on a variety of factors, including their learning style, goals, and resources.\\nOn the one hand, learning by oneself can be very rewarding and empowering. It allows the learner to set their own pace, focus on their specific areas of interest, and take control of their own education. It can also be more convenient, as it allows the learner to study at their own convenience and doesn't require them to coordinate with a teacher or class schedule.\\nHowever, learning by oneself can also be more challenging and time-consuming. Without the guidance and support of a teacher, it can be difficult for the learner to stay motivated and on track, and they may struggle to find resources and materials that are tailored to their needs. Additionally, learning by oneself may not provide the same opportunities for feedback, guidance, and personalized instruction that a teacher can offer.\\nOn the other hand, learning with a teacher can be a more structured and supported approach to learning. A teacher can provide clear goals and expectations, offer feedback and guidance, and help the learner stay motivated and on track. They can also provide resources and materials that are tailored to the learner's needs, and can offer personalized instruction to help the learner understand difficult concepts.\\nHowever, learning with a teacher can also have its challenges. It may require more time and effort to coordinate with a teacher or class schedule, and the learner may not have as much control over their own learning experience. Additionally, not all teachers are equally effective, and the learner may not always find the teaching style or approach of their teacher to be a good fit for their needs.\\nIn conclusion, both learning by oneself and learning with a teacher have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the best approach will depend on the individual learner's goals, learning style, and resources. Some people may find that they prefer one approach over the other, while others may benefit from a combination of both methods. Ultimately, the most important thing is to find a learning approach that works best for you and helps you achieve your goals.\"\n",
            " 'There are valid arguments for both sides of this debate, and ultimately the decision of whether it is better for children to grow up in the countryside or in a big city depends on individual circumstances and priorities.\\nOn one hand, growing up in the countryside has several advantages. For one, children who live in rural areas often have more opportunities to be outside and engage in physical activities, such as playing sports, hiking, or exploring nature. This can promote healthy habits and a love of the outdoors that may not be as readily available in a city setting.\\nAdditionally, the pace of life in the countryside is often slower and more relaxed than in a big city, which can provide a more peaceful and stress-free environment for children to grow up in. Children who grow up in rural areas may also have a stronger sense of community and may be more connected to their neighbors and extended family.\\nOn the other hand, there are also many benefits to growing up in a big city. For one, cities often offer a wider range of educational and cultural opportunities for children. There may be more diverse schools and extracurricular activities available, as well as access to museums, libraries, and other cultural institutions.\\nIn addition, living in a city can provide children with exposure to different cultures and ways of life, which can broaden their perspective and understanding of the world. This can be especially valuable for children who may not have the opportunity to travel as much.\\nUltimately, the decision of whether it is better for children to grow up in the countryside or in a big city depends on individual circumstances and priorities. Some families may value the slower pace of life and close-knit community of the countryside, while others may prioritize access to educational and cultural opportunities in the city. It is important for families to carefully consider their own values and needs when making this decision.'\n",
            " \"There are benefits to both planning and not planning activities for one's free time. Those who prefer to carefully plan their leisure activities may do so for a variety of reasons. One benefit of planning is that it allows for more efficient use of time. By scheduling activities in advance, individuals can ensure that they are making the most of their free time and not wasting it on unproductive or unfulfilling pursuits. This can be especially helpful for those with busy schedules or specific goals in mind, as it allows them to fit in the activities that matter most to them.\\nAnother benefit of planning is that it can help to reduce stress and uncertainty. By having a clear plan in place, individuals can feel more in control of their time and less anxious about what to do with it. This can be especially useful for those who are prone to feeling overwhelmed or indecisive. Planning can also help individuals to feel more organized and on top of their commitments, which can lead to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.\\nOn the other hand, some people prefer not to make any plans for their free time and instead choose to be spontaneous. One benefit of this approach is that it can allow for greater flexibility and adaptability. By not having any fixed plans, individuals are free to take advantage of opportunities that arise unexpectedly and can be more open to new and spontaneous experiences. This can lead to a sense of excitement and adventure, as well as the opportunity to try new things and be open to new possibilities.\\nAnother benefit of not making plans is that it can allow for greater relaxation and downtime. Without the pressure of having to adhere to a strict schedule, individuals can take things as they come and simply go with the flow. This can be especially helpful for those who lead busy and stressful lives and need to find ways to relax and recharge.\\nIn my personal experience, I prefer to have a balance between planning and not planning for my leisure time. While I find that planning can be helpful for achieving specific goals or maximizing my time, I also appreciate the freedom and flexibility of being spontaneous. I think that both approaches can be valuable depending on the situation, and that finding the right balance is key to having a fulfilling and enjoyable leisure time.\"\n",

Normally, I would either have more time to finish the work or finish the work earlier and leave home earlier.\\nAnother reason that I prefer to get up early is because I can enjoy the beauty of the nature. When I get up early, I can really feel the cool weather and fresh air in the morning. And I would say it is best time of the day to plan for the day's work.\\nI also choice to get up early because I can beat the traffic jam at my residential area.

            " 'Obviously, the first teachers we have in our lives in most cases are our parents. They teach us to walk, to speak, and to have good manners before we reach \"the real world.\" More than even the professional teachers that we have in school, parents are generally the most involved in the development and education of children.\\nAlmost for sure our parents are the best teachers at the beginning of our lives, which actually corresponds to the parents\\' role in nature. Parents are most committed and involved in teaching their children; they have a kind of instinct to sacrifice a part of themselves for the betterment of their children. They love us and have great patience while passing down their knowledge to us. They wish us a success and thus will not teach us bad things. And of course, implicit learning occurs when children unconsciously copy some of their parents\\' habits and styles of behavior.\\nDuring the second stage of child development, adolescence, parents can still be in the best position to offer advice even though the children might not accept it. In this case, perhaps the child\\'s friends would be the best teachers. Adolescents are notoriously rebellious in many cultures and may automatically reject any advice from their parents. My first marriage for instance, was solely a matter of doing the opposite when my parents tried to intrude in offering their advice. So in such matters, parents should be much more flexible and be rather the partners with their children. So we can see that being a teacher of growing child become more and more complicated case as the time passes and many parents are simply not able to meet the increased demands.\\nOn the other hand, I would say that parents are not professional teachers and they tend to be very biased by their love of their children. So wishing good things and an easy life may prevent children from maturation. In any case, parents usually can present only one viewpoint of the world, while good teaching should be based on different attitudes. Thus, when children go to school and have a great diversity of teachers, they learn much more than their parents could probably give them. Furthermore, once our parents get older, they become more conservative and cannot always be objective in regard to modern trends and fashions. Thus we need to take their advice with caution during that period. However, some kind of intuition, which I believe, shared between relatives about what everybody needs and great love, which exists in families, still makes our parents very good teachers and advisers at any time.\\nIn conclusion, while parents are not the ideal teachers, and well-rounded children will generally need a great diversity of teachers in their lives in order to have a more accurate view of the world, parents are generally the most committed of all teachers and have the greatest emotional investment in their children and their future'\n",

The development of satellite technology has revolutionized telecommunications, weather forecasting, and navigation, among other things. The search for extraterrestrial life has also sparked public interest and curiosity about the universe.\\nHowever, I believe that governments should prioritize spending on our basic needs on Earth before investing in space exploration. The reason for this is simple: there are still millions of people on our planet who lack access to basic necessities such as clean water, healthcare, education, and nutritious food.\\nOne of the main arguments for investing in space exploration is the potential economic benefits it could bring. While it is true that space-related industries have the potential to generate significant economic growth, it is important to consider the distribution of these benefits. Many space programs are funded and operated by governments, and the profits generated are often funneled back into the development of new technologies and missions, rather than being used to address pressing social and economic issues on Earth.\\nIn contrast, investing in our basic needs on Earth has the potential to improve the lives of millions of people and create a more equitable and sustainable society. For example, investing in clean water infrastructure and sanitation can significantly reduce the burden of waterborne diseases, which disproportionately affect low-income communities. Similarly, investing in education and healthcare can provide people with the skills and knowledge they need to improve their lives and break the cycle of poverty.\\nIn conclusion, while the exploration of outer space has brought numerous benefits to humanity, I believe that governments should prioritize spending on our basic needs on Earth. Investing in the well-being of our own planet and its inhabitants is essential for creating a more equitable and sustainable future for all.'\n",

However, the extent to which each group influences a child's academic performance can vary depending on various factors.\\nOn one hand, classmates can play a crucial role in a child's academic success. For instance, if a child has classmates who are academically motivated and encourage their peers to do well in school, it can create a positive learning environment and inspire the child to work harder. Classmates can also provide valuable support and encouragement during difficult times and can serve as a source of inspiration for a child to achieve their academic goals.\\nOn the other hand, parents often have a more profound influence on a child's academic success than their classmates. Parents are typically the primary caregivers and role models for their children, and they have a direct impact on the child's upbringing and development. Parents can influence their child's academic success by providing a stable and supportive home environment, setting high expectations for their child's education, and being involved in their child's school life.\\nAdditionally, parents can also provide practical support to their child's academic endeavors, such as ensuring that their child has access to necessary resources, such as textbooks and study materials, and providing transportation to and from school.\\nIn conclusion, both classmates and parents can have a significant impact on a child's academic success. However, while classmates can serve as a source of encouragement and support, parents often have a more profound influence on their child's academic performance due to their unique role as primary caregivers and role models.\"\n",
            " \"Some people think that children should begin their education as early in their lives as possible, while others think that children should spend most of their time playing. Each opinion could be supported by a number of arguments. However, it is my opinion that playing is more important activity than learning for children during their early years.\\nIt could be argued that it's important that some basic logical and verbal skills be learnt as early as possible. The argument goes on to assert that the children much more easily accept skills like basic calculus and foreign languages when they are very young. Moreover, if children start their education early, they can have more time to perfect their knowledge later during their lives. This way they can become better professionals. Finally, when children are at school, they parents don't have to look after them. Instead, they can work and earn more money for themselves, as well as their children.\\nIn contrast to these opinions, there are others who claim that children should at least have their childhood, since their whole life will be most probably filled with work and study. Furthermore, physical skills, which are developed by playing, are just as important as intellectual ones. When children are not forced to go to school at an early age, they can spend more time with their parents. In fact, it is often claimed that don't need teachers other than parents, since parents know them best and are most committed to teaching them.\\nMy opinion is that young children should spend most of their time playing. It seems to me that it's not natural for children to start formal education earlier than age 6, for instance. All the teaching they need can be provided informally, by parents. On the other hand, early physical development can't be compensated later, and it would suffer greatly if children were not allowed to spend enough time playing.\\nAs we can see, young than by older children more easily process certain types of information, which is why some people claim that this advantage should be exploited by making children study while they are still very young. However, I disagree with this approach, since I think that children should be above all allowed to spend their early childhood the way they like best, and that is playing and having fun with their friends.\"\n",
            " 'I agree that children should be required to help with household tasks as soon as they are able to do so. Here are several specific reasons why:\\nFirst and foremost, helping with household tasks helps children to develop important life skills. These skills include things like responsibility, time management, and problem-solving. By participating in tasks like setting the table, doing the dishes, and taking out the trash, children learn to take ownership of their actions and the consequences that come with them. They also learn to manage their time effectively by completing tasks in a timely manner and to problem-solve when faced with unexpected challenges, such as finding a missing sock or figuring out how to clean a particularly stubborn stain.\\nAnother reason why children should be required to help with household tasks is that it promotes a sense of teamwork and cooperation within the family. When children contribute to the upkeep of the household, they feel like valued members of the family and are more likely to pitch in when needed. This sense of teamwork and cooperation can have a positive impact on family dynamics and can help to build stronger bonds between family members.\\nFinally, requiring children to help with household tasks can also help to reduce stress and workload on parents. With both parents often working outside of the home and with busy schedules, it can be overwhelming for one or both parents to manage all of the household tasks on their own. By assigning age-appropriate tasks to children and holding them accountable for completing them, parents can delegate some of the workload and have a little extra time for themselves.\\nIn conclusion, I believe that children should be required to help with household tasks as soon as they are able to do so. Not only does it help them develop important life skills, promote teamwork and cooperation within the family, and reduce stress on parents, but it also teaches children the value of hard work and the importance of contributing to the household.'\n",

This news has likely sparked a heated debate within the community, as the construction of a factory can have both advantages and disadvantages. It is important to carefully weigh these pros and cons before making a decision on whether or not to support the factory.\\nOne potential advantage of the factory is that it could bring new jobs to the community. This could be particularly beneficial for those who are currently unemployed or underemployed, as the factory may offer higher paying and more stable positions. The factory could also generate additional tax revenue for the community, which could be used to fund necessary public services and infrastructure projects.\\nHowever, it is important to consider the potential negative impacts of the factory as well. For example, the factory may emit pollutants into the air and water, which could have negative effects on the environment and the health of community members. The factory may also generate noise and traffic, which could be a nuisance for those living in close proximity. Additionally, the factory may alter the landscape and character of the community, which could be a concern for those who value the aesthetic and cultural aspects of the area.\\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to support the factory will depend on the specific circumstances of the community and the willingness of the company to address and mitigate any potential negative impacts.

For example, if you love to cook, spending time in the kitchen preparing a meal may be a great way to relax and de-stress. Similarly, if you enjoy working with your hands, you might find that activities such as woodworking or painting can be therapeutic.\\nAnother effective way to reduce stress is to make time for self-care and prioritize your own well-being.

Many people wear different kind of clothes for different occasions. For example, formal clothes are generally worn for interviews, seminars, official meetings, and most of the places its a dress code for the employees. People are supposed to behave formally in formal dress. It implies that the man or woman in the formal dress has proper manners, behaves gently and carries high standards. Anybody wearing the formals acts to represent the glory of the dress. It is expected out of him/her to behave decently and carry high standards. No matter if that person is not capable of representing the code of dress, but when he/she is wearing the dress, the feeling comes alive to him/her and the result is what we see as the their behavior being different in that particular dress.\\nSame is true for informal or casuals as it is popularly known as.

It let people to enjoy, play around and to be free from all the mundane Activities. No one can notice the artificial act of a person when he/she is in casuals. People also know that they are not supposed to be what they are not inside a casual.\\nLet us take another example of occasions where the dress code commands people. Talk of marriages and festivals and the whole picture becomes clear in mind. One can see the bride carrying that beautiful smile mixed with shyness, not only because of occasion, but also because of the dress. She knows that she is wearing the dress, which every girl aspires for, and she knows how she has to act when she wears it. It is applicable for the groom. He carries the dignity and charm with him because he knows that when he is wearing the wedding clothes, he has to act accordingly. He cannot act in the same way as he does when he is wearing casuals or formals.\\nPeople get ready for festivals not only with great enthusiasm and anxiety, but also with their special dresses. In many countries there is a dress code for different festivals. People are supposed to wear it and when they are inside that special dress, they have to be out of them and act as a person who best represents the dress.

On the other hand, if a person is miserable in their job because they do not enjoy the work or feel that it is not meaningful, a high salary may not be enough to compensate.\\nAdditionally, the work environment and culture of a company can have a big impact on job satisfaction. If a person feels valued and supported by their coworkers and superiors, and if the company has a positive and inclusive culture, they are likely to feel more fulfilled in their job. In contrast, a toxic or unsupportive work environment can make even a high-paying job unbearable.\\nFinally, the balance between work and personal life is an important consideration.

These modes of transportation were either slow or limited in their ability to travel over land. The invention of the automobile, with its ability to quickly and easily travel long distances on land, opened up new possibilities for where people could live and work.\\nThe automobile also greatly increased the speed at which people could travel.

On the other hand, others argue that daily homework can be overwhelming and burdensome for students, leading to increased stress and decreased motivation.\\nOne argument in favor of daily homework is that it helps students to reinforce concepts learned in class. When students complete homework assignments, they are given the opportunity to practice and apply what they have learned in a more controlled setting. This can help to solidify their understanding of the material and improve their retention of the information.

This can involve stepping out of one's comfort zone and trying something new or taking a chance on an opportunity that may seem uncertain or risky. For example, an entrepreneur who starts a new business venture is taking a risk, as there is no guarantee of success. However, if the entrepreneur is able to identify a market need and develop a product or service that meets that need, their risk-taking could lead to significant success. Similarly, an individual who pursues a career in a creative field, such as the arts or entertainment, may need to take risks in order to stand out and succeed in a competitive industry.\\nOn the other hand, careful planning is also essential for achieving success. This can involve setting clear goals and developing a roadmap to achieve them, as well as anticipating and managing potential challenges and obstacles. For example, a student who wants to get into a top university may need to carefully plan their course of study, extracurricular activities, and test preparation in order to increase their chances of acceptance. Similarly, a business owner who wants to grow their company may need to create a detailed business plan that outlines their strategies for marketing, sales, and financial management.\\nIn conclusion, success in life can come from both taking risks and careful planning. While one approach may work better for some people, it is important to find the balance that works best for you. By considering both the potential rewards and risks of different courses of action, and by combining the creativity and flexibility of risk-taking with the discipline and focus of careful planning, you can increase your chances of achieving success in your personal and professional endeavors.\"\n",

Personally, I prefer the latter because I find that working with one\\'s hands will reap a greater sense of satisfaction when the task has been completed. Consider a case. Your friend\\'s birthday is coming up. It would be absolutely fabulous if you could send her a gift personally, right up her doorstep instead of sending her an electronic greeting card with the computer in your bedroom. Doing things with your own hands brings allows us to appreciate the fruits of labor and hard work.\\nThe virtual world is far too distant and unrealistic. Human touch is still the most sincere way to make friends and communicate with your loved ones. Moreover, an over reliance on machines will tend to make us less capable in completing simple task. Taking a short ten minute walk to the shop opposite your house to buy some daily necessities will benefit our health because it allows us to exercise our limbs after lying on a couch in front of the television for over two hours but majority of the people nowadays will choose to drive there instead, claiming that it saves time and strength. Human\\'s natural ability to move and do work has depleted over the years with the invention of machines which enable us not to even move ourselves to get things done. It would benefit and foster family relationships by doing things together such as cleaning the house or clearing the garden with your siblings instead of ordering the maid-\"a human machine\" around or following a schedule to take turns to clean up the mess using a vacuum cleaner in less than half an hour.\\nNevertheless, machines does indeed provide us with a much more efficient and faster way to complete a task in hand like typing a resume or an essay instead of writing it out.

            " 'My personal belief is that the best way to learn about life is through personal experience. But this does not mean that I totally disregard the alternative way of learning by listening to family or friends’ advice. The truth is that now, at my age, I clearly see that the best way of learning about life would be a combination of the two (ways noted above).\\nThe main reason I embrace the first way is because I find it more natural, it is our instinctive way to act and react. When we are young we are prone to experience than to listen to other persons advice and less to the advice coming from our family. This may not be a general case but I believe the exceptions are rare. I remember when I got engaged with my future husband both my parents and friends were very much against my decision. And in a way they were right. But I wanted to follow my heart and to have my own judgment even if people with more experience and even good intention were advising me to do the contrary. My reaction/action it was also influence by the wrong approach my family adopted. And my case is not an isolated one.\\nFrom my above story can be inferred that I DO agree that learning by listening to the advice of well-intended people is a wise way. It would probably save us some grief and disappointment in life. But I strongly believe that even painful the experience we choose to have is helping us grow and builds our personality. I never regretted my decision to get marry at a pretty early age even if eventually we (me and my husband) ended up divorcing. It was one of the best experience I ever had, though the most painful in my life.\\nI conclude by encouraging youngsters to try to listen both to their heart and to other persons advice and judge which way would be the best for them. Although I sound like my mother some years ago, when she tried to convince me that at my age the marriage is not the best choice in life, I strongly recommend to everybody to accept listening to any advice before making a decisive step in life and afterwards to filter all these information. I think it is wise trying to combine these two ways of learning about life.'\n",

The daughter is expected being of tender and gentle so that she would get married a good man that means she would have a good fortune and her parents would not be worried because she does not make a living herself. As a good son or daughter, one of the most important qualities is he or she has to be obedient and submissive everything for their parent. For example, he or she would marry with a person who would be satisfied by their parents rather than loved by themselves. However, in modern society, no matter son or daughter, the best quality is that they are positive, motivating, and responsible facing their life. Parents hope their son or daughter capable of do everything independently and wisely referring to their suggestion.\\nSecondly, several good qualities are remained and are developed. With the development of society, more and more girls are educated and are able to support she, even others. Hence, the qualities of a good boy basically are the same as those of a good girl.

Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Both approaches have their own advantages, and the choice ultimately depends on an individual's personality and preferences.\\nOne advantage of spending time with one or two close friends is the depth of the relationships. When you have a small number of friends, you are able to devote more time and attention to each of them, and as a result, the relationships tend to be more intimate and meaningful. You may feel more comfortable sharing personal details and vulnerabilities with a close friend, and you may also feel more supported during difficult times. In addition, close friendships tend to be more reliable and stable, as you are able to rely on each other and work through any issues that may arise.\\nOn the other hand, spending time with a large number of friends has its own advantages. For one, having a diverse group of friends can expose you to different perspectives and experiences, which can broaden your horizons and help you learn new things. In addition, having a large social circle can provide a sense of belonging and community, and it can be fun to have a variety of people to hang out with. With a large group of friends, you may also have more flexibility in terms of social plans, as you have a larger pool of people to choose from.\\nAs for my own preference, I tend to lean towards spending time with one or two close friends.

The choice ultimately depends on an individual's personality and preferences, and it is important to find a balance that works best for you.\"\n",

When boys and girls are separated, they may be subject to different expectations and standards based on their gender, which can lead to the reinforcement of gender roles and stereotypes. For example, girls may be encouraged to focus on more traditionally \"feminine\" subjects, such as literature and art, while boys may be encouraged to focus on more traditionally \"masculine\" subjects, such as math and science. This separation can reinforce harmful ideas about what activities and subjects are appropriate for each gender, which can have long-term consequences on students\\' self-esteem, career choices, and relationships.\\nAnother reason I disagree with separating boys and girls in schools is that it can limit the social and emotional development of students. When boys and girls are separated, they may miss out on important opportunities to interact with and learn from each other.

            " 'According to me an animal could be considered important based on what it contributes to mankind. In India the most important animal is the Cow. It is important as it provides a source of food to people, it is an animal, which can be used for labor, and also the Indian people religiously worship the cow.\\nMajority of the people in India are Hindus. According to Hindu beliefs and customs, the cow is religiously worshiped. Temples are built in respect of the animal, and the animal itself is considered holy. These animals are allowed to wander freely anywhere they please, whether it be on the farmlands and fields, or the city streets. In Mumbai and other metropolitan cities of India one would find many cows roaming on the streets. People will very often buy grass and hay, to feed the animals. Although they do cause hindrance to vehicular traffic, but people would never harm them. Car drivers would patiently wait for a cow to move off the center of the road, without honking. Their horns or doing anything to scare the animal. This is because of the fact that they worship the animal, and they feel that the animal is important. According to the Hindu religion the god Shri Krishan happened to also be a cow herder, and hence the cow is also worshiped.\\nIn India the main source of milk, happens to be the cow. Every day, dairies all over India supply several million liters of milk. They happen to be the cheapest supply of milk for the people, without which tens of thousands of babies would go unnourished. Thousands of verities of dairy products and sweets are made from fresh cows milk. Without the cow this would not be possible. Hence the animal is of prime importance to the nation. Also apart from milk, the cow also happens to be the main source of meat in the country. Beef is widely consumed throughout the country. The Muslim community, which happens to be the second largest community in India, are forbidden by religion to consume pork or any other form of pig meat. For them and for other communities also, the cow happens to be the only source of meat, as goats and sheep are not reared in as large numbers and are not found as abundantly as the cow is.\\nApart form being a source of meat, the cow is also used on farms for plowing the fields, and for pulling the bullock carts. In India the farmlands are not consolidated, and hence are very often divided among family members. This makes the size of the farm plots very small. Also most farmers are not very wealthy. Due to these reasons automation is not feasible. Hence for plowing the fields, for carrying the grains etc cows are employed on the farms. Cows are also considered as very docile and tamed, and loving animals, which can easily be used as animals of burden.\\nFor the Indian people, the cow is not just as an animal of worship, but also a source of food and milk. It is also a very useful animal of burden and can be tamed easily. Hence it has gained the most importance in India.'\n",

The impact of the automobile on average peoples’ lives could be analyzed in three ways: technical, economical and social concepts.\\nFirstly in technical impact, the automobile formed a new proficiency in humans, which includes operating mechanical device by practicing and of course, memorizing new skills.

They are responsible for imparting knowledge, skills, and values to the next generation, and their work has a lasting impact on the lives of their students. With this in mind, it is natural to consider the question of how teachers should be paid and whether or not their salaries should be tied to the performance of their students.\\nThere are arguments on both sides of this issue, and it is difficult to come to a definitive conclusion. However, in my opinion, I do not agree with the statement that teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Here are some specific reasons why:\\n1. Teachers cannot control all factors that affect student learning: A teacher's job is to educate and guide students, but there are many other factors that can impact a student's ability to learn. These include the student's home environment, their health and wellbeing, and their personal motivation and engagement with the subject matter. A teacher cannot be held solely responsible for a student's learning if there are other factors at play.\\n2. Paying teachers based on student performance could lead to negative consequences: If teachers are paid based on student performance, there is a risk that they may feel pressure to focus solely on teaching to the test or grades rather than on providing a well-rounded education. This could result in a narrow, superficial approach to teaching that ignores the broader goals of education, such as critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, if teacher pay is tied to student performance, it could create an unhealthy competition among teachers and lead to a focus on individual rewards rather than a collaborative approach to education.\\n3. Other factors should be considered when determining teacher pay: There are many factors that should be taken into account when determining teacher pay, such as their level of education, years of experience, and the demand for their subject area. Additionally, teachers often go above and beyond their job duties, taking on extra responsibilities and working long hours outside of the classroom to ensure the success of their students. These extra efforts should also be considered when determining teacher pay.\\nIn conclusion, while it is important to recognize the crucial role that teachers play in the education of their students, I do not believe that their pay should be tied solely to the performance of their students. There are many other factors that should be considered when determining teacher pay, and tying it to student performance could lead to negative consequences for both teachers and students.\"\n",

            " 'The issue that children should help with household tasks is one that is open to debate. On the one hand, some people think that children should not be required to help if there is not need for them to do part of the household tasks. Some people also say that is preferable for children to devote more time to playing, reading and watching interest things on TV. On the other hand other people support the idea of teaching children household tasks and make them help at home. I adhere to the latter point of view. I base my opinion on the following points.\\nFirst, helping in our houses when we are children teaches us of the ways of doing household tasks. This might be very useful in our future, even if we can hire someone to do those things for us. I have three sisters and my mom always explained to us how to cook, clean or iron our clothes. We also had a maid to help us with most of the chores, but anyway my mom wanted us to learn. It is well known that is very difficult to correct the job of someone else if you don’t know the job yourself. Thanks to this learning, I can now handle many of my houses tasks, and when my maid cannot come to my house I anyway manage to go to work with my clothes clean or ironed. Moreover, it helped me grow by learning that all of us have responsibilities at home, even if it is a minor one such as preparing toasts for breakfast.\\nSecond, doing the household tasks helps you be more tolerant with others, put yourself in their situation and understand them more. Before I practiced this kind of tasks at home, I usually though that keeping a house clean and tidy was a very simple and minor issue. Now, I don’t. I’ve learnt to appreciate how energy consuming doing the household can be and how many things need to be done before we arrive at home and see everything in perfect conditions. This has helped me grow as a more considerate person. I value the job of those who work for me. I’ve felt how boring and exhausting cleaning a house can be, and I try to recognize through a fair pay this job.\\nThird, I believe that you can learn household activities and help at home without resigning to other activities. When I was a child I helped my mom with part of the chores, but however had plenty of time to read and play with my friends. Doing part of the household did not affect either my academic performance or my social activities. Hence, as my sisters and I helped at home, my mom could also have a personal life and spend more time playing with us.\\nTo sum up, I believe that is a good idea to make children help with some of the household tasks even if there is no need to do so because someone else can handle it. In my opinion, doing part of the household promotes children to grow and mature as responsible and considerate people, and does not affect their academic or personal life.'\n",

While on one hand, when the computer revolution, especially the mainframes has given a new Life to the space age and mankind has thus been able to explore space to such an extent that space is no longer a mystery to us. On the other hand, the need based and intelligible use of computers has solved the greatest problems in the industry and agriculture as well. The tremendously useful and efficient control system instrumentation in industry has made productivity of plants rise in leaps and bounds.

Imagine if everyone takes their time to do every thing that they should do, things wouldn't be done on time, there would be chaos, anarchy and total disorder. For example, the police would fight crime when they feel like or the president of a country would address urgent humanitarian needs at his own time or children would go to school when they feel like. Such a situation would lead to the total breakdown of a society.\\nIf I have to do things at my time, then I would miss a lot of opportunities in life. For example, if an unemployed graduate like myself spends the whole day doing chores in the house, when I could do the house chores quickly and attend seminars related to my field that could keep me updated on recent developments in my field and in the long run enhance my job prospects.\\nImagine if workers in a company take their time to do things at a slower pace, then such an organization is bound to fail because things wouldn't be done on time and such a company would lag behind its competitors.\\nNo matter what some people feel I think is better for people to do things in a hurry to prevent disaster, promote efficiency and make one available for opportunities?\"\n",
            " 'There is no denying that many young children spend a great amount of their time practicing sports. Some parents encourage their children to practice sports for various reasons, such as improving physical health, developing social skills, and building character. However, there are also some drawbacks to this.\\nOne of the main advantages of practicing sports at a young age is that it can improve physical health. Children who are involved in sports tend to be more physically active, which can help them maintain a healthy weight, build strong bones and muscles, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Furthermore, practicing sports can also improve coordination, balance, and flexibility, which can benefit children in their everyday activities.\\nAnother advantage of practicing sports at a young age is that it can help children develop social skills. Sports can provide children with an opportunity to interact with their peers, learn teamwork, and develop leadership skills. In addition, children who are involved in sports often have a sense of belonging to a team or club, which can boost their self-esteem and confidence.\\nA third advantage of practicing sports at a young age is that it can help children build character. Children who practice sports are often taught the values of discipline, perseverance, and sportsmanship, which can help them develop a strong work ethic and a positive attitude. These values can also translate to other areas of their lives, such as school and relationships.\\nHowever, there are also some disadvantages to practicing sports at a young age. One of the main drawbacks is that it can be time-consuming and require a significant commitment. Children who practice sports may have less time to spend with their families or pursue other interests, such as music or art. In addition, practicing sports can be physically and mentally demanding, which can lead to burnout or injuries. Children who are injured may also experience emotional distress and may need to take a break from sports to recover.\\nIn conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to practicing sports at a young age. While sports can improve physical health, develop social skills, and build character, they can also be time-consuming and physically demanding. It is important for parents to consider these factors when deciding whether to encourage their children to practice sports and to ensure that their children are participating in sports in a healthy and balanced way.'\n",

For example, with just a few clicks, one can find detailed explanations on a wide range of topics, access primary sources, and connect with experts in their field of interest. Additionally, the Internet allows for quick and easy communication, making it easier for people to collaborate and share ideas with others around the world.\\nOn the other hand, it can also be argued that access to so much information creates problems. One problem is the issue of misinformation and fake news.

This can lead to the spread of misinformation, which can have serious consequences, such as influencing public opinion or causing harm to individuals.\\nAnother problem is the issue of overload. With so much information available online, it can be overwhelming for people to sort through and determine what is relevant and accurate. This can lead to information overload, which can be mentally exhausting and make it difficult for people to make informed decisions.\\nIn conclusion, while the Internet provides people with access to a wealth of valuable information, it also creates problems such as the spread of misinformation and information overload.

Some believe that long-term employment allows for increased productivity and loyalty, while others argue that it limits a company's flexibility and opportunities for growth. Ultimately, it is important for businesses to carefully consider the pros and cons of long-term employment and make a decision that is best for both the company and its employees.\\nOne argument in favor of hiring employees for their entire lives is that it can lead to increased productivity and loyalty. When employees know that they have a secure job for the long term, they may be more motivated to work hard and contribute to the company's success. In addition, long-term employees often have a deep understanding of the company's culture and processes, which can make them more efficient and effective in their roles. Moreover, employees who feel secure in their jobs may be more likely to stay with the company for the long haul, resulting in lower turnover rates and the associated costs of training new employees.\\nOn the other hand, some argue that hiring employees for their entire lives can limit a company's flexibility and opportunities for growth. For example, if a company is facing economic challenges or needs to pivot its business model, it may need to reduce its workforce or make other changes to adapt. If a company has a large number of long-term employees, it may be more difficult to make these changes. In addition, hiring employees for their entire lives may limit the company's ability to bring in new perspectives and ideas from outside candidates. This can be particularly important in fast-paced industries that require constant innovation.\\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly benefits to hiring employees for their entire lives, it is important for businesses to carefully weigh the pros and cons and make a decision that is best for both the company and its employees. In some cases, long-term employment may be the right choice, while in others, a more flexible approach may be necessary.

Therefore dancing plays an important role in a culture.\\nThe first characteristic of dance that can tell us about a certain culture is the body movement. By varying physical actions and using different dynamics, human being can fashion an infinite number of body movements. Out of the range of movements that the body is capable of performing, every culture emphasizes certain features in its dance styles.

People often dance as a way of releasing powerful feelings, such as sudden accesses of high spirits, joy, impatience or anger. This emotional expression way can be seen not only in individual dances but also in the more formalized and collective dances such as tribal war dances or festive folk dances.

Each plays different roles for people. In my opinion, knowledge from experience is more important than that from books.\\nExperience first can prove if the knowledge formbooks are true or false. Textbooks are very wonderful in teaching people essential principles, how is the world looks like? What is the basic law of change of people and things? We can learn a lot through primary school, secondary school until university.

So far, there have been many transportations vehicles such as: automobile, bicycles, and airplanes… When these transportations vehicles were invented, they all make people’s lives change. In these essay, I would like to talk about the way airplanes change people’s lives because among three transportations vehicles: automobiles, bicycles, airplanes, I think airplanes have changed people’s lives the most powerfully.\\nFirstly, airplanes change the way people move. Before airplanes were invented, people could go on land, on water and dreamed to fly like birds on the sky. The dream came true when the first airplane was produced. Since then, people have been able to fly on the sky, see everything from height. That’s wonderful feelings. Therefore, airplanes are great invention. They have given people new feelings. On the basic of airplanes, people can continue their dream more and more such as: coming to another plane…. Producing airplanes is the first step to approach to long step after that.\\nSecondly, advantages of airplane make people more comfortable in the life. The speed of airplane is very fast, so people can save time, which is one of the most precious things of each person. It takes a little time to go from one place to another than other transportation vehicles like automobiles, bicycles, and train… In Vietnam, it takes forty-eight hours to come from Hanoi to Ho Chi Mink city by automobile; meanwhile it takes two hours by airplane. Moreover, services of airplane firm are very good. Thus, it is convenient for passenger to choose airplane to go anywhere. Perhaps, airplanes aren’t the safest transportation means, but with long distance, it is better to choose airplane.\\nFinally, with airplanes, the relationship between people is more and more closer. It is easier to meet cousins in family, friends because going by airplane is very convenient. The special days like New Year, Noel… are gladder because every member in family can attend. The world seems to be smaller. Airplanes connect every part in the world. The distance wasn’t a big problem when airplanes were born. In conclusion, airplanes really change people’s lives.

Be it letters, e-mails, or telephonic conversations, I think that no means is more effective than face-to-face dialogue.\\nFirstly, face-to-face dialogue affords the speaker the opportunity to convey his message in a more detailed and complete way. Emotions, moods and expressions come forth to the surface in a face-to-face interaction, unlike written words or those spoken on the telephone. By using tone, facial gestures and body language, the speaker gives a thorough idea of the listener of his point of view. For example, by leaning forward on his chair, opening his arms and moving his hands in a forceful manner, the speaker can convey interest and leadership.\\nAnother benefit that face-to-face communication provides is immediate feedback. The speaker can clarify any confusion right away. Unlike written statements, no idea or thought is lost in grammatical errors or misuse of vocabulary. Since all people involved in the conversation can easily see each other, approval, interest, or disregard, can easily be deduced and dealt with.\\nOften we see messages getting confused, and warped up in a maze of paperwork or unanswered e-mail and telephone calls. Such accumulation of data can create lot of stress and undue mess-ups in an office environment. Renowned CEOs, like Bill Gates are famous for making a point to show up at all business meetings, and if not possible, designate another person instead of using written words, or the telephone.\\nThey say, \"Nothing can replace the human touch.\" When people say that, what they mean is that the openness, camaraderie, and opportunity for feedback obtained through face-to-face dialogue is totally irreplaceable and invaluable.'\n",

When you have friends who have similar interests, values, and experiences, it can be easier to relate to each other and feel a sense of belonging.

            " 'Whether boys and girls should attend separate schools or not is a complex and controversial issue. Some people think attending separate schools is benefit for boys and girls to put their heart into studies. On the other hand, other people argue that boys and girls would be benefit from not only studies but also social skills if they were put together in the same schools. In the final analysis, I prefer the latter one to the former one. In the following discussion, I would like to have evidence to support my view.\\nFirst of all, the disadvantage of attending separate schools is that the mutual sex will be suffering in the future because of lacking the knowledge about the opposite sex. One of my friends, for example, who was in separate high schools, lost the regular psychological mind after breaking up with her first boy friend. Because she didn’t know boys very well, she hoped they could get along well as the relationship between she and her girlfriends. However, her boyfriend didn’t do as what her girlfriends did such as going shopping for a whole day. She was disappointed by him and had an extremely terrible fight with him. They broke up in the end. She was hurt so deeply that couldn’t control her behavior any more.\\nSecond of the place, the advantage of attending mixture schools is that boys and girls can help each other more efficient than those in separate schools. Because of different physical minds, they have different ways to think about questions. When they communicate together, they exactly can get some new ideas from others. I still remember after discussing with my partner who was a smart guy, I learned to consider the same thing with different ways. In this case, I really benefit from those experiences to work out every possibility in my work.\\nHowever, it may be true that in the mixed schools students will be affected by falling love so early. But the thing is when girls from separate schools meet strangers they are much easier be attracted by opposite sex than those from mixed schools. So this alone can’t constitute sufficient support to the view that boys and girls should attend separate schools.\\nGiven the reasons discussed above, the conclusion, which may intertwine at the beginning of discussion and thus become more persuasive, may be safely reached that it’s not necessary for boys and girls to attend separate schools.'\n",

Because of this reason many people think that classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child’s success in school. I totally agree with this statement in the light of my experiences and my other friends’ experiences. In this essay, I will try to figure out how classmates are an important influence on a child’s success in school.\\nFirst of all, at the very beginning of the school years, children meet new friends and they get close with some of them either because they get along with them well or they are in the same neighborhood. It is very normal for a child to have new friends that she likes and have enjoyable time but sometimes these classmates become a very important influence on a child’s behavior. This behavior can affect her positively or negatively. For example my cousin had had some friends at school. She liked them a lot but I felt something wrong as soon as I met them. I talked to my cousin about it but she didn’t listen to my advices. Later on she realized that her friends were using drugs and cut her relations with them. My cousin and her family had to move to another city because this event affected my cousin very much and she suffered some psychological problems. My cousin had to give up her school for a year and took her 2 years return to her normal life.\\nOn the other hand, classmates can influence a child’s success in school in a good way. Because, to my way of thinking, meeting new people, getting to know them, is an important experience in one’s life. Studying together, helping each other with some problems is very useful. For example, I study with my friends for the exams and I think it is very helpful. One of my friends can solve a mathematics problem that the others cannot solve, so we complete each other. I sometimes don’t feel like studying but my friends force me to study and I thank them for that. Because sometimes one needs motivation and friends are there at this times.\\nFinally, we can say that classmates are an important influence on a child’s success in school. The important point is that how they influence a child’s success. And as long as we have good friends, they play an important role in our success.\\n'\n",

This is because most of the youngsters in my village are reluctant to follow their ancestors’ step to become a fisherman. They wish to pursue a better job in the city. By building a big shopping center, it will surely bring up a lot of working opportunities for the community. Some can work as executives while others can work as salesperson in the shopping center.\\nOther than that, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the community a more comfortable and more convenient place to shop. As the weather in Malaysia is so hot, it will be an ideal spot to go shopping for its air-conditioning environment compared to the small stuffy grocery store down the town. On the other hand, it is much more convenient to shop in large shopping center where you can get nearly most of the goods here, from veggies to undergarments, just name it.\\nFurthermore, the shopping center will most probably benefit the community by offering goods in better price. The shopping center will eventually exist as a main competitor to the other grocery stores and sundry shops in town.

            " \"Rooms are one of the many important factors in a house. Architectures, when drawing the plan of a house consider these room-factors seriously. When we are buying a house, new or old, we place emphasis on the different types and number of rooms in the house, their conditions, seizes, general orientation and other factors of the very rooms like the windows, the height of the ceilings and so on. However, among the different types of rooms that can be found in today’s modern houses, I consider the most important to be the sitting room.\\nThere is an adage or a saying that the sitting room is the marrow of the house. This is very right. For example if the sitting room is always dirty, one can always expect the whole house to be dirty too. So the living room shows the hygienic condition of the house.\\nFurthermore, the sitting room is very important because when we have visitors, we rarely invite them to our bedrooms or to the toilet or to the bathroom. No. We invite them to sit in the sitting room where we welcome them or discuss some issues. For sure, they look around to see how tidy is the room, how is it arranged and what we have in the house. That impression of the sitting room will always be with them about the whole house, about how we live and how tidy we are. In these regards, the sitting room serves as the face of the house, a sort of the public relations manager.\\nApart from the above-mentioned reasons, the sitting room is much more important than the other rooms for the very purpose it is supposed to be: for sitting. Having a place to sit in the house is very important. For example, imagine coming from a very hard days job, very tired. Sure the first thing one does on getting to the house is to head for the sitting room, most probable get a cold drink from the refrigerator and relax by sitting down in the sitting room, put on the television and for a moment forget about the hard days job.\\nIn conclusion, the sitting room is very important in the house for the purposes it serves, mainly, it portrays and gives impressions to others about how we live, how tidy we are, that is, it is the mirror and the public relation 'manager' of the house, and it is one of the best place where we can relax in the house.\"\n",
            " 'It is a very dangerous thing to say that basic literacy skills are more important now than they have ever been in the past. While a strong argument can be made in favor of this idea, making such an argument would imply that reading and writing were somehow less important in the past. While there is a grain of truth to the argument that literacy was not fundamental to the daily existence of most people in the pre-Industrial Revolution period, rationalizing such a lack of need for education in such a way is the first step to withholding education from certain groups, a great social crime that has led to the disempowerment of disadvantage groups all over the world throughout history. However, if we can keep in mind that education is a basic human right, then we can discuss the strengths of the proposition that literacy is more important now than it has ever been before.\\nIt is true that in the past the majority of people all over the world made their livelihood from agricultural activities and that the vast majority of these activities required little or no literacy skills. In some senses, we could argue that literacy skills were less important in the agricultural age than they are now, but to do so would be to forget that literacy also reflects an active mind and that people have always needed to engage in activities of the mind. For example, even though a farmer might have labored all day in her cornfield, she may enjoy reading the latest Jane Austen novel when arrived at home. We can see in this example that while literacy was not directly related to this laborer\\'s livelihood, literacy was important to her quality of life.\\nHowever, we could make a good argument that literacy is more important now that it was in the past. As we all know, the world is experiencing a revolution that may turn out to be more important than the Industrial Revolution. We are now entering the Information Age, an age in which information and knowledge have more value than the ability to build machines, create \"stuff,\" grow crops, or even mine precious metals and produce gemstones. Nowadays, accurate information may be worth more than the most expensive Rolls Royce or the biggest diamond. The perfect example of this increasing dominance is the explosive rise in the popularity of the Internet--the Internet offers the world countless bytes of information twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Companies all over the world, but principally in the United States, are rushing to stake their claim in cyberspace and stiff competition among companies has resulted. In order to gain dominance, these companies must have the best-skilled workers, an advanced understanding of computer systems, and good intuition about what will happen in the future. All of these abilities to compete in the global marketplace stem directly from literacy skills and those without these skills will be stuck in the service, agricultural, and heavy industry fields.\\nIn short, we can see that people in the past who were lacking in literacy skills essentially had more company than those lacking these skills have today and could still earn their livelihood. Further, we could argue that because of the nature of the global marketplace and because of the emergence of the Information Age, we could make the argument that literacy is fundamental to professional success nowadays. However, literacy should be considered a basic human right in a literate society--all people throughout history should have learned to read and write.'\n",
            " \"Establishing a new university in a community can bring both advantages and disadvantages.\\nOne advantage of a new university in the community is the potential for economic growth. Universities often bring in a large number of students, faculty, and staff, which can increase the demand for housing, restaurants, and other local businesses. This can lead to an influx of money into the community, as well as the creation of new jobs. Additionally, the presence of a university can attract research funding and other investment opportunities, further boosting the local economy.\\nAnother advantage is the opportunity for increased access to education. A new university in the community can provide more options for higher education, making it easier for local students to stay in the area and pursue their studies. This can be especially beneficial for those who may not have the resources or desire to travel far from home for college.\\nHowever, there are also potential disadvantages to consider. One potential issue is the strain that a new university can put on the community's resources, such as roads, public transportation, and utilities. The increased population and demand for services can also lead to issues with overcrowding and a lack of available housing.\\nAdditionally, the construction of a new university can lead to environmental concerns, such as the potential for habitat destruction and the emission of greenhouse gases. It is important for the community and the university to consider and address these issues in the planning and development process.\\nIn conclusion, while a new university in the community can bring economic growth and increased access to education, it is important to carefully consider the potential disadvantages and take steps to address them.\"\n",
            " \"Books are an important part of many people's lives in the world today. With such a wide variety of topics that books are written on; they can be broadly classified into fiction and non-fiction. These two types each have their own merits and it would not be fair to only read about 'real events, real people' when there can be so much to learn from imaginary events and people.\\nNon-fiction has greater practical value in the 'real' world and the information gleaned can be applied intensely at home, at work or in school. Various topics of interest can be researched easily and a greater knowledge level can be obtained. Yet the disadvantage of non-fiction lies in the fact that nothing happens to excite the mind and spirit. In short, many people find these books 'boring' since only facts are provided. However well written the book may be, in the end it leaves little room for the imagination. Consequently this is an area where fiction excels.\\nWith various stories on different characters, places, fantastical storylines and evil villains, the journey through fictional books can be one filled with adventure and excitement. The reader may be left with ideas that will serve in many areas. Fiction provides great scope for the mind to think creatively. In fact, many of books written to portray 'imaginary' events or characters can educate and send a subtle message through the book. This effective technique has been used successfully by a large number of writers. Yet it is true that many people cease to enjoy fiction, as they grow older failing to see its importance in the world. This perspective is not entirely untrue because dragons, castles or evil aliens will not help an engineer in any way as it might help him spend the same time by reading about how a particular bridge was constructed in Germany.\\nTherefore, both non-fiction and fiction provide an equal number of opportunities for people to cultivate their mind. The best solution, it would seem is to read both fiction and non-fiction and have the best of both worlds.\"\n",
            " \"In today's digital age, there are many different ways to communicate with others, including face-to-face, letters, email, and telephone calls. While each of these methods has its own advantages, I believe that face-to-face communication is generally better than other types of communication.\\nOne of the main reasons that face-to-face communication is superior is that it allows for the most accurate form of communication. When we communicate in person, we can use a variety of nonverbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions, to convey meaning and intent. These nonverbal cues can often provide additional context and help us better understand the person we are communicating with. Additionally, face-to-face communication allows for immediate feedback and clarification, as we can ask questions and have them answered in real-time.\\nAnother advantage of face-to-face communication is that it promotes stronger relationships. When we communicate with others in person, we are able to build a deeper connection with them through shared experiences and more meaningful interactions. This can lead to more trust and understanding between individuals, which is especially important in professional and personal relationships.\\nHowever, it is important to note that face-to-face communication is not always possible or practical. In some cases, other forms of communication, such as email or telephone calls, may be more efficient or convenient. For example, if we need to communicate with someone who is located in a different time zone or country, it may be easier to send an email or make a phone call.\\nOverall, while other forms of communication have their own advantages, I believe that face-to-face communication is generally the most effective and meaningful way to communicate with others. By being able to see and interact with someone in person, we are able to convey our message more accurately and build stronger relationships.\"\n",
            " \"In everyone's life, there is some influence of other person, either they are parents or friends. In my opinion, friends are the most important influence on young adults. I will explain this by giving some examples as below.\\nIn the early age of person, there is more influence by family. But as soon as becoming the younger, they come more contact to friends rather then family. Younger people like the company of their age with whom they can share their ideas, thoughts, life etc. With some good friends, one can develop itself taking examples from the good friends. Friends can exchange their good thoughts, developing careers, and some good and bad things with friends also. Some talks are like that one cannot share it with family but can share with friends.\\nSecondly, friends play an important role in our lives. They are the most important people who can change one's path by giving them right decision or right advice or may spoil the life by giving the wrong advice. Its all depends on type and nature of friends. If we have good friends, who can understand and knowledgeable person, they are always helpful to us. In the contrary, if friends are not good, then in their friendship, one can spoil his/her life also. I would like to give example here, how friends can more influence on young adults. When I was studying in the collage, there is one group, in which some boys are good and some are not good. Some boys are on the wrong track. I mean to say that they have habit of smoking, drinking etc. In that group, some boys are really nice, but after some time they also started smoking and drinking. Which is not good for the health. This makes impact on young adults.\\nIn sum up, I would like to say that friends are the most important influence on young adults, rather then family because of above reasons\"\n",
            " 'Television is undoubtedly one of the most powerful means of communication in the history of humankind, rivaled only by such other forms of communication as the Internet, the telephone, movies, and, of course, simple, low-tech speech. Television, with its wide availability and rich media with image and sound, is difficult to ignore and even seductive in its appeal. Television is as much a part of our lives as are our meals, work, or school; studies consistently show that the average American child spends almost as much time watching television as she does in school. Furthermore, because television is so rich in its media, it often requires our full attention or is more attraction to us than are our daily lives. Naturally, the more time one spends watching television, the less time she has with her family and friends. Thus, we can clearly see why some have claimed that television has been harmful for communication among family and friends. However, I believe that, while television has been somewhat harmful in its effects, it has hardly \"destroyed\" communication among family and friends for most people, although for some, this may be true.\\nMost people much prefer spending time with their families and friends to spending time watching television. Television is of course an important part of many people\\'s lives, but most people would gladly choose family and friends over television were they given the choice. Furthermore, most educated people are aware of the deleterious effects of too much television and either avoid excessive time watching television, or actually do not enjoy it. I, for example, after a long day at work, would much rather spend time talking with my wife and playing with my children than I would watching some unrealistic portrayal of life on television. For my family, and me our time together is precious and beautiful, and could never be replaced or hurt by television.\\nFurthermore, the effect of television is simply not so great that it could be said to have \"destroyed\" communication among family and friends. Granting that communication among family and friends in industrialized countries has decreased in recent years, it might be tempting to blame this problem on television since its rise roughly coincided with the decrease in time we spend with our families. However, I believe this situation is more likely due to increased pressures relating from work, school, and the economy. In my case, for example, I find that my pressures from work are so great that I must often sacrifice time at home so that I can meet the challenges of running my own business. Many of my friends are in similar situations--my best friend, for example, has just finished law school, which took about sixty hours a week of his time. In a word, people nowadays have very little time for anything, but television is not the cause--it is increased desire to succeed.\\nIn some situations, however, television has surely contributed to a decrease in communication among family members. In my childhood in the countryside, I often saw parents and children watching television for hours on end, rarely speaking with one another. It seemed for them that television was a way to escape from their sad, miserable existence. However, even in this case, I would say that television merely contributed to the bad situation, but did not cause it; were television not existent, surely these people would have found other escapes, alcohol or gambling, for example. In other words, people always find a way to do what they want to do.\\nIn short, I do not believe that television has destroyed or even harmed interpersonal communication among most people. Most people realize that television is merely a temporary diversion and do not use it to replace interpersonal communication. I believe that the damage attributed to television is greatly exaggerated and that such damage is most likely attributable to other more powerful social factors.'\n",
            " \"There are certainly advantages to living in a place with consistent weather or climate all year round. For one, it can be easier to plan and prepare for daily life when you know exactly what to expect in terms of weather. For example, if you live in a place with hot, sunny weather all year round, you can plan your wardrobe and activities accordingly, without having to worry about suddenly encountering cold temperatures or inclement weather. Similarly, if you live in a place with consistent cold weather, you can invest in warm clothing and gear that you can use throughout the year.\\nHowever, personally, I would prefer to live in an area where the weather changes several times a year. One of the main reasons for this is that I find the variety of weather to be more interesting and enjoyable. While it can be nice to have consistent weather, it can also get monotonous over time. In contrast, living in an area with changing weather allows you to experience a range of seasons and weather patterns, each with their own unique characteristics.\\nFor example, living in an area with four distinct seasons allows you to enjoy the beauty of spring flowers, the warmth of summer sun, the colorful foliage of fall, and the cozy feeling of winter snow. Each season brings its own activities and opportunities, whether it's going on hikes in the spring, swimming in the summer, apple picking in the fall, or building snowmen in the winter.\\nIn addition, living in an area with changing weather can also provide some benefits in terms of your physical and mental health. Studies have shown that exposure to natural light can have a positive impact on your mood and well-being, and experiencing different types of weather can provide a change in scenery and atmosphere that can be refreshing and rejuvenating.\\nOverall, while living in a place with consistent weather can have its advantages, I believe that the variety and changing nature of weather in an area with several seasons is ultimately more appealing and enriching.\"\n",

In my opinion, knowing the meaning of life and what one wants out of life can actually help a person to live out a fairly productive life.\\nLife represents different things to various people. Some people view life as mesmerizing and worth living, while others just take it for granted and don't really give it much thought. Knowing what life is really about is of great importance to me. I have always been amazed at the multitude of living beings that presently inhabit the earth. What is the meaning of life? How did it come about in the first place? What can be done to make living here on earth worthwhile? Someone who is famous might actually have some interesting thoughts to share on this subject.\\nIt surprises me that no one ever asks such questions from famous people. People like to interview a famous person and ask all sorts of personal questions. I think that asking this single question and carefully observing the speaker can actually reveal a lot about the speaker's personality and outlook than asking personal questions. This is because famous people might become somewhat defensive and not entirely honest when asked to describe their personality traits or likes/dislikes. But asking them about their outlook about life gives them space to talk about a lot more than just answering some to-the-point questions.\\nAsking a famous person about his/her view about life might also help us out in how we can view the world around us. Often people who become famous or successful have positive outlook towards present and future. They don't worry about the hardships of the past. This might motivate others to adopt a similar positive view of life.\\nIn short, I would really like to ask a famous person about his/her outlook on life, which in effect, will let me know something about the famous person as well.\"\n",

In our lives we are always trying to look for a good area to live, a nice house, and most important of all good neighbors. This will influence in the decision of either moving to the area, or star looking for another area. In my opinion a good neighbor will be those who are respectful, friendly, and helpful.\\nThe first quality that good neighbors should have is to be respectful. Respect is the most important aspect of being good neighbor. Neighbors should respect your space and privacy in order to live in a peaceful environment. Being a respectful neighbor means not invading your personal space as well as your property. Another example will be to maintain a quiet environment not allowing loud music, or noise that will bother others. Respect to one another is the most important quality that a neighbor should have in order to live in harmony.\\nAnother quality of a good neighbor is that it should be friendly. All people should be friendly to one another, but this quality is most important when it comes to neighbors. Neighbors are close to you, to your home, property and most important to your family. You might not see them every day, but they live next to you all the time. These are the reasons why they should be friendly. One of the ways to be friendly is by showing they care about you, and they should welcome you to their neighborhood. Friendly neighbors make a good and united society.\\nThe last quality of good neighbor is that it should be helpful. Neighbors as well as everyone should be helpful to one another. Helpfulness is a characteristic that everyone should have. A helpful neighbor is that, that in the times of need is there for you. For example, if a person is in a situation where he/she needs a moral support for the lost a loving family member, the neighbor should give this person all the support he/she might need and encourage he/she that they can count on them no matter what.\\nOverall good neighbors are those whom are respectful in every way. Friendly, that every time you see them they greet you with a good smile. And good neighbors are those whom are helpful when ever you need a supporting hand.'\n",

With out his kind, generous nature I would hasn’t recovered before the exams and I would have got low grade.\\nAlso roommate should be competitive. This is because this will increase our studies growth a little bit faster and always try for the highest grade in the exams. At the same time we should not depress by looking at the roommate's progress in the exams. Infect, we should take that progress as a challenge and keep trying for the good grade. For example, I always used to take inspiration from my roommate percentage and used to get the more or less equal percentage with him. This resulted in increasing my position in class from top10 to top5 ranks.\\nCo-operation also one of the important quality of the good roommate. This would eventually helpful in sharing the knowledge of the subject and also resources like reference books and writing material.

For me easy way to get food is restaurant, where I can get prepared food at home or office by just ordering on phone, Along with that another comfort is, that when ever I have to eat together with my so many friends, I can always go to a restaurant, otherwise it’s difficult to prepare food at home for so many people and don’t get time to talk and having fun.

Along with that when I eat at restaurant I have more time to do other things like reading, watching TV, and listening music, going out theatre, or having fun with friends, that don’t make me tired or boring and I feel refreshed for next day work, so by going to restaurant I can manage a lot more activities instead preparing food.\\nIn addition, in restaurant I get a variety of food choice, I can have taste of different regions, for example Indian restaurant I can get varied food from North Indian to South Indian Punjabi, Bengali, Madrasi, Maharashtrian, etc. at one place.

It has given people the freedom and convenience to travel long distances quickly and efficiently, allowing for greater mobility and access to opportunities. It has also made it easier for people to transport goods and products, facilitating trade and commerce.\\nIn addition, the automobile industry has created jobs and contributed to economic growth, and the development of new technologies in the automotive sector has led to innovations in areas such as safety and fuel efficiency.\\nOn the other hand, it is also true that the automobile has caused serious problems, particularly in terms of environmental and public health.

It broadens his horizons and makes him aware of different points of view on any subject. It also makes him socially more active and as is commonly said, \"Man is supposed to be a social animal\".\\nOn the other hand being with a couple of close friends helps a people achieve a level of intimacy not possible in a large group. They develop a bond between them that is hard to break. Such people share an understanding, which leads to high levels of loyalty. It leads to a kind of friendship that can be depended on in any kind of situation. Such friends are truly loyal and would never shrink back from supporting each other.\\nI personally prefer spending time with my close friends, who happen to be just one or two. They are the friends I am absolutely comfortable with. In school I had just two good friends who I am very close to. I can share any thought of mine with them. Very often they understand my feelings without me having to state them explicitly. In college I have a large number of friends, and though I can discuss a variety of subjects with them, I do not share the level of intimacy with them that I share with my school friends.\\nDue to these reasons, I prefer having a couple of close friends.

However, I disagree with this statement.\\nFirst and foremost, it is important to recognize that teenage children at this age are transitioning from childhood to adulthood. They are beginning to gain more independence and responsibilities, and should be allowed to make their own decisions as they navigate this new phase of life. While it is important for parents and adult relatives to provide guidance and support, it is ultimately the teenager's life and they should be given the opportunity to make their own choices.\\nFurthermore, allowing teenagers to make their own decisions can help them develop critical thinking skills and responsibility. By being able to make decisions on their own, teenagers can learn to weigh the pros and cons of different options and understand the consequences of their actions. This can also help them develop independence and become more self-sufficient.\\nAdditionally, it is important to consider the fact that teenagers at this age are old enough to understand the gravity of important decisions and the impact they may have on their future. For example, decisions related to education or career paths are significant and can have long-lasting consequences. It is important to allow teenagers to have a say in these types of decisions, as they are the ones who will be most affected by them.\\nIn conclusion, while it is natural for parents and adult relatives to want to protect and guide their teenage children, it is important to recognize that teenagers at this age are transitioning to adulthood and should be given the opportunity to make their own important decisions.

They have made many tasks faster and more efficient, and have provided us with access to vast amounts of information at our fingertips. However, there is also a valid argument that computers have made life more complex and stressful.\\nOne of the main ways that computers have made life easier is by automating tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming and labor-intensive. For example, with just a few clicks, we can now book a flight or make a hotel reservation online, rather than spending hours on the phone or in line at a travel agency. Computers have also made it easier for people to work from home, allowing them to save time and money on commuting and providing more flexibility in their schedules.\\nHowever, the convenience of computers also comes with a cost. Many people now feel pressure to constantly be connected to the internet and to respond to emails and messages immediately. This constant connectivity can lead to feelings of stress and overwhelm, as we try to juggle multiple tasks and responsibilities at once. Additionally, computers have made it easier for us to multitask, which can actually decrease our productivity and make us feel more stressed.\\nAnother way that computers have made life more complex is by introducing new risks and vulnerabilities. With the increasing reliance on computers and the internet, we are now exposed to a wide range of online threats, such as hacking, phishing, and malware. These threats can not only compromise our personal information, but also disrupt our daily lives and cause stress.\\nIn conclusion, while computers have made many aspects of life easier and more convenient, they have also introduced new complexities and stressors.

Others may find watching movies to be more enjoyable because they can experience the story in a more visual and auditory way, without having to do as much mental work to fill in the details.\\nOne reason that some people may prefer reading fiction to watching movies is that reading allows them to fully immerse themselves in the story. When reading a book, a person can take their time to really get to know the characters and understand their motivations and emotions. They can also take their time to fully absorb the details of the plot and the setting, and use their own imagination to visualize everything. This can be a very immersive and satisfying experience for some people.\\nIn contrast, watching a movie often requires less mental effort, as the visuals and sound effects help to bring the story to life. However, this can also be a disadvantage for some people, as it may be harder to fully engage with the story and become invested in the characters. Some people may find that they are more easily distracted by the visual elements of a movie, and that they don't get as lost in the story as they do when reading a book.\\nAnother reason that some people may prefer reading fiction to watching movies is that reading allows them to engage with the story at their own pace. When reading a book, a person can take breaks whenever they want and come back to the story at a later time without losing their place or missing any important details. In contrast, when watching a movie, a person has to commit to watching the entire thing in one sitting and may feel pressure to keep up with the pace of the story.\\nOn the other hand, some people may prefer watching movies to reading fiction because they find it to be a more visually and emotionally engaging experience. Movies can be more cinematic and dramatic, and can often convey emotions in a more powerful way through the use of music, camera angles, and other visual elements. Additionally, some people may find that watching a movie is more convenient than reading a book, as it requires less time and effort to sit down and watch a movie than it does to read a book.\\nIn conclusion, whether reading fiction or watching movies is more enjoyable is ultimately a matter of personal preference. Both have their own unique advantages and drawbacks, and it is up to the individual to decide which one they prefer. Some people may find that they enjoy the immersive and mentally engaging experience of reading, while others may prefer the more visual and convenient experience of watching movies.\"\n",
            " 'There is a common belief that businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. However, I disagree with this statement. While it is true that businesses exist to make a profit, this does not mean that they should engage in unethical or irresponsible behavior in order to achieve this goal.\\nFirst and foremost, businesses have a responsibility to uphold ethical standards and operate in a socially responsible manner. This includes respecting the rights and well-being of their employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate. If a business is willing to sacrifice these values in the pursuit of profit, it is likely to face negative consequences such as damage to its reputation, loss of customer trust, and potential legal consequences.\\nAdditionally, prioritizing profit above all else can lead to short-term thinking and a lack of focus on long-term sustainability. For example, a company may prioritize maximizing profits in the present by cutting costs and ignoring the impact of its actions on the environment. However, this approach is not sustainable in the long run, as ignoring environmental concerns can lead to negative consequences such as pollution and resource depletion.\\nOn the other hand, businesses that take a more holistic approach to making a profit, considering the needs of all stakeholders and the long-term sustainability of their operations, are likely to be more successful in the long run. These companies often have strong reputations, loyal customers, and motivated employees, all of which contribute to their financial success.\\nIn conclusion, while it is important for businesses to make a profit, this should not be their sole focus. Ethical and socially responsible behavior, as well as a long-term perspective, are crucial for the success and sustainability of any business.'\n",

However, I disagree with the statement that there is nothing that young people can teach older people.\\nFirstly, young people often have a fresh perspective on things that can be valuable to older people. With their limited life experience, they may approach problems and ideas with a different perspective that can lead to innovative solutions. For example, younger people may be more adept at using technology and may be able to teach older people how to use new devices or navigate new software.\\nSecondly, young people can also teach older people about current trends and popular culture. As younger people are often more immersed in contemporary society, they can provide insight into what is popular and relevant in the present moment. This can help older people stay current and understand the perspectives and experiences of younger generations.\\nAdditionally, young people can also teach older people about the importance of maintaining an open mind and being open to new ideas. As we age, it can be easy to become set in our ways and resistant to change. However, young people can remind us of the value of flexibility and adaptability in our thinking.\\nIn conclusion, while older people may have more life experience and may have much to teach younger people, there are also many things that young people can teach older people. From a fresh perspective and current knowledge of trends and technology to the importance of an open mind, there is much that young people can offer those who are older.'\n",
            " \"One important natural resource that is disappearing at an alarming rate is forests. Forests provide a range of benefits to both people and the environment, and their loss can have serious consequences.\\nOne reason forests need to be saved is that they provide vital ecosystem services. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and produce oxygen, making them an important part of the planet's carbon cycle. They also act as natural filters for water, helping to purify and regulate the flow of water in rivers and streams. In addition, forests provide habitat for a wide range of plant and animal species, many of which are endangered and at risk of extinction if their habitats are destroyed.\\nAnother reason forests need to be preserved is that they have significant economic value. Forests are a source of timber, which is used for construction and other purposes. In addition, forests support a range of industries, including tourism, which can provide jobs and income for local communities.\\nThere are also cultural and social reasons to save forests. Many indigenous communities depend on forests for their livelihoods, and the loss of forests can have a devastating impact on their way of life. In addition, forests are often considered sacred by indigenous communities, and their destruction can have spiritual and emotional consequences.\\nThere are several ways that forests can be preserved and protected. One approach is through the creation of national parks and other protected areas, which can help to safeguard forests from logging and other forms of development. Another approach is through the promotion of sustainable forestry practices, which allow for the harvesting of timber in a way that is environmentally responsible and promotes the long-term health of forests.\\nIn conclusion, forests are a vital natural resource that need to be saved for the sake of both the environment and the people who depend on them. Their loss can have serious consequences, including the loss of vital ecosystem services, economic disruption, and cultural and social upheaval. It is important that we take action to protect and preserve forests for the benefit of current and future generations.\"\n",

It suggests that no matter how difficult a task may seem, or how many obstacles one may encounter along the way, it is important to keep trying and to never give up on one\\'s goals.\\nThere are many examples of individuals who have exemplified this idea by continuing to persevere and work towards their goals, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges. For instance, consider the story of Thomas Edison, who is famous for his persistence and determination in the face of failure. Edison is often quoted as saying, \"I have not failed. I\\'ve just found 10,000 ways that won\\'t work.\" This attitude of perseverance allowed Edison to eventually invent the light bulb, a revolutionary technology that has had a profound impact on the world.\\nAnother example of the power of \"never, never give up\" is the story of Roger Bannister, who was the first person to run a mile in under four minutes. This feat was once thought to be impossible, but Bannister\\'s determination and hard work allowed him to break through this barrier and achieve his goal.\\nIn my own life, I have also seen the importance of perseverance and determination. For example, I remember struggling with a particular subject in school. It was difficult for me, and I was tempted to give up and move on to something else. However, I decided to keep working at it, even though it was challenging. I put in extra time and effort, seeking help and guidance when needed, and eventually I was able to master the subject. This experience taught me the value of never giving up, even when things get tough.\\nIn conclusion, I agree with the statement \"Never, never give up.\" This expression embodies the importance of perseverance and determination in achieving one\\'s goals. It reminds us that even when faced with challenges and setbacks, it is important to keep trying and to never give up.'\n",

Since my neghborhood is pretty far from the city's center I have to drive several hours until I find a good restaurant. The result is that I, as well as the other members of the neighborhood, go only to restaurants only in special occasions (for instance, in birthdates). When the restaurant will be built I will have the opportunity to go to restaurants more often, the way other people from other neighborhoods do.\\nIn addition, the restaurant may offer work for the students who live in our neighborhood. If the restaurant will be successful, it will naturally need a lot of waiters. The students in my neighborhood, who need to work in a working place that allows flexible working hours, would love finding a job where they can earn some money. Therefore, if the restaurant will hire them as waiters, it might help them a lot. I can take myself as a good example: when I was a student I lived in another neighborhood where two restaurants were located. I used to work as a waiter in one of these restaurants, earning money for the university's tuition fees.\\nIn conclusion, I strongly support building the new restaurants in our neighborhood. The restaurant will allow me (as well as to the other neighbors) to eat in a restaurant more often. The new restaurant might also offer job opportunities to the students of the neighborhood.\"\n",
            " 'Going to the movies is a pleasure for a lot of people and I\\'m one of those who are really fond of movies. When I heard that a new theater might be built in my neighborhood, I was first very excited about this idea. But after having had a good think about it, I wondered if it was really a good thing. First of all, I will focus on the reasons why I support this idea and secondly, I will move on to analyzing why I oppose this idea.\\nOver the past 10 years, it\\'s abundantly clear that the seventh art has much changed. Indeed, from special effects to THX sound, we all could have seen the very progresses of the cinema. In spite of that, theaters remain the same and are getting older. As a matter of fact, it begins sometimes difficult for the audience to appreciate a movie at its real value. I mean, not only does the screen is most of the time to small, but the sound is also bad in a lot of theaters. In the case in point, it is bad in the old theater in my neighborhood. Therefore, I would say that it is a pity to see a \"modern\" movie in such conditions.\\nHowever, we should not forget that a theater is a place full of remembrances. For instance, a place where year after year, a lot of people have laughed, or shrilled, or cried in front of hundreds of movie, all different. Sometimes, you can see fathers who take their children in the same theater where they used to go twenty years earlier! We should bear all this in mind. So, I am in disagreement with those who think that a theater is just a place made of a screen, walls, and chairs, because it is much more than that. I strongly believe that it is made of remembrances and magic moments too.\\nAll in all, as far as I am concerned, I agree to say that it would be a good idea to build a new theater in order to benefit from more comfort and better conditions. In the meantime, I can\\'t help thinking that what matter most is, above all, all the remembrances kept into old theaters. To put it in a nutshell, I would say that I favor building a new theater, but I will keep on going to the older one.\\n  \\n '\n",
            " \"Movies and television have a significant influence on people's behavior. This is because these media forms provide people with examples of how to act and interact with others, as well as offering opportunities to vicariously experience different lifestyles and situations.\\nOne way that movies and television influence behavior is through the portrayal of social norms and values. Many movies and television shows depict certain behaviors as acceptable or unacceptable, which can shape people's understanding of what is considered normal or appropriate in society. For example, a movie that portrays bullying as something that is acceptable or even cool may lead some viewers to believe that this type of behavior is okay in real life, while a movie that portrays bullying as wrong may discourage people from engaging in this type of behavior.\\nAnother way that movies and television influence behavior is through the depiction of role models and characters that people aspire to emulate. Many people look to characters in movies and television as sources of inspiration and guidance, and may attempt to adopt certain behaviors or lifestyles as a result. For example, if a television show features a character who is successful and confident, some viewers may try to adopt similar traits in an effort to be more like the character.\\nMovies and television can also influence behavior through the portrayal of consequences for certain actions. By showing the consequences of certain behaviors, movies and television can serve as cautionary tales that discourage people from engaging in certain types of behavior. For example, a movie that shows the consequences of drug use may discourage some viewers from trying drugs in real life.\\nIn addition, movies and television can influence behavior by providing people with vicarious experiences that allow them to explore different situations and lifestyles. This can help people to gain a better understanding of different perspectives and ways of life, which can in turn shape their behavior and how they interact with others.\\nOverall, it is clear that movies and television have a significant influence on people's behavior. Whether through the portrayal of social norms and values, the depiction of role models and characters, the portrayal of consequences for certain actions, or the provision of vicarious experiences, these media forms can shape people's understanding of the world and how they should behave in it.\"\n",
            " 'Technology has undeniably had a significant impact on the world and the way we live. Some argue that it has made the world a better place to live, while others disagree. In this essay, I will argue that technology has indeed made the world a better place to live, and provide specific reasons and examples to support my opinion.\\nOne of the main ways that technology has made the world a better place to live is by improving communication and connectivity. With the widespread use of the internet and social media, it is easier than ever before to stay in touch with people around the world. This has made it possible for people to maintain relationships with friends and loved ones who live far away, and has also made it easier for people to connect with others who share similar interests or goals. In addition, technology has made it possible for people to collaborate and work together remotely, which has made it easier for people to live and work in different parts of the world.\\nAnother way that technology has made the world a better place to live is by improving access to information and education. The internet has made it possible for people to access a vast amount of information on virtually any topic, which has made it easier for people to learn new things and expand their knowledge. In addition, technology has made it possible for people to take online courses and earn degrees from top universities without ever leaving their homes. This has made education more accessible to people who may not have had the opportunity to attend a traditional brick-and-mortar school.\\nTechnology has also made the world a better place to live by improving healthcare and increasing life expectancy. With the development of advanced medical technologies, such as electronic health records and telemedicine, healthcare providers are able to diagnose and treat patients more accurately and efficiently. In addition, technology has made it possible for people to monitor their own health and manage chronic conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease, from home. This has made it easier for people to stay healthy and live longer, more fulfilling lives.\\nFinally, technology has made the world a better place to live by improving transportation and making it easier for people to get around. With the development of electric and autonomous vehicles, it is now possible to travel long distances without relying on fossil fuels, which has reduced air pollution and made it easier for people to live in more environmentally friendly ways. In addition, ride-sharing services and public transportation apps have made it easier for people to get around without owning a car, which has made transportation more accessible and convenient for many people.\\nIn conclusion, technology has made the world a better place to live in a number of ways. It has improved communication and connectivity, increased access to information and education, improved healthcare, and made transportation more convenient and environmentally friendly. While there are certainly valid concerns about the negative impacts of technology, the overall benefits of technology for society are undeniable.'\n",
            " 'Optional attendance to classes at universities has been an increasingly popular way for students to study for several years in quite a few countries. However, it has not yet had its intended results as it had been hoped. In fact, today, this system seems to be one of the reasons for the corruption of university education. In my opinion, compulsory attendance is better than having no requirement to attend all the lessons on-campus.\\nThere are two points of view to this question. First, one side will say that university students are adults and should be able to manage their time as they see fit. This point of view says that sometimes, in today’s busy world, people need flexibility to manage their lives. For example, many single parents who are trying to earn their college degrees will sometimes need to skip a class because of the demands of their other responsibilities. However, I believe that the great majority of college students are young and single, and have few responsibilities, and that they need the discipline and structure of a system that requires attendance. Young people who have just gone off to college are notorious for the excesses to which they enjoy their freedom.\\nThere are many negative situations caused by the free-attendance system. The most harmful one is the economic waste for both universities and students. Many students who do not attend classes regularly are likely to suffer decreased performance on their exams and therefore waste their time in college. They, generally, do not feel panic because of the failures or restudying the same subjects for the second time. However, this sometimes costs a fortune to both parents and the government that have created tax-funded subsidies for education for each student every year. Not only are the university fees wasted, but also the money for accommodations and other spending are also wasted.\\nOn the other hand, students who are required to attend classes regularly have no time to waste in pubs or clubs. Nor can they spend these young years, which are more valuable to them to learn and think than any other period in their lives, on gambling or drinking. I do not mean they are only to study without any break or entertainment. Their social life is as necessary as studying during the hard academic years; yet, the amount of each should be balanced well. More spare time than necessary encourages the young to ignore studying and classes. Thus, neither the universities nor the students do their best if the students have too much freedom not to study.\\nTo sum up, many teenagers are not able to think sensibly to decide when to study and when to enjoy with friends. A scheduled chart of classes, which have a huge number of options that are necessary to identify the best fitting one for each student, will help them to construct an ideal campus life including leisure activities. In addition, this will stop the waste of time and money and is likely to reevaluate the higher education system in several years. In short, I believe that the majority of college students are too young to manage their time responsibly and that universities should therefore impose strict rules on attendance.'\n",
            " \"Parents are often considered the best teachers because they are the first role models that children have and they spend a significant amount of time with their children. However, I believe that while parents can certainly play a crucial role in a child's education and development, they are not necessarily the best teachers for every subject or topic.\\nOn one hand, there are many reasons why parents can be the best teachers for their children. Firstly, parents have a deep understanding of their child's needs, abilities, and learning style. They can tailor their teaching methods to suit their child's individual needs and provide support and encouragement when needed. Secondly, parents have a unique and special bond with their children, which can create a positive and supportive learning environment. This can make it easier for children to ask questions, seek help, and feel confident in their learning.\\nAdditionally, parents can teach their children valuable life lessons and impart their own values and beliefs. They can also provide practical knowledge and skills that may not be taught in school, such as budgeting, cooking, and maintaining a household.\\nHowever, there are also some limitations to the idea that parents are the best teachers for every subject. While parents may have a strong foundation in certain areas, they may not have the necessary knowledge or expertise to teach their children more advanced or specialized subjects. For example, a parent who is a skilled musician may be able to teach their child the basics of music theory and how to play an instrument, but they may not have the training or experience to teach more advanced music theory or technique.\\nFurthermore, parents may not always have the time or resources to provide their children with a well-rounded education. They may not have access to the same resources or materials that schools do, or they may not have the knowledge or expertise to teach their children certain subjects. In these cases, it may be beneficial for children to seek additional education and support from other sources, such as teachers or tutors.\\nIn conclusion, while parents can certainly play a crucial role in a child's education and development, they are not necessarily the best teachers for every subject or topic. It is important for parents to recognize their limitations and seek additional support and resources when needed, in order to provide their children with a well-rounded and comprehensive education.\"\n",

Nonetheless, youth are the product of its upbringing and the representation of its time. Thus, what they are and what they know will certainly be different from those of the older generation. Therefore, to say that the youngsters are useless is not only wrong as they can also contribute in their own way and teach the older generation a lesson or two.\\nAs we all know, today\\'s technology moves very fast. With our daily responsibility, it is almost impossible for us to keep up with every little new gadget that comes out everyday. With young people, its different, new things interest them. Furthermore, being young they absorb new knowledge like a sponge. Thus, they can help us in getting in tune with new technologies. Young kids, for example, can probably teach their grandparents to use the computers, which in turn, will also be good for their relationships.\\nIn addition to that, by looking at the young, we can learn about the society better. As I\\'ve mentioned earlier, youngsters represent their time, hence, by understanding them, we can understand the needs of the society, as this group of age is the most outspoken. A good example would be the hippie movement in the 60s. The movement displayed their dissatisfaction with the system and the need for more freedom of expression.\\nAs someone once said, \"Life is a learning experience\", thus, from that, we can deduce that there is no full stop to the process of learning. Therefore, instead of being critical and cynical, maybe we can try to understand the youth better by learning from each other. After all, they are the future.'\n",

When I am traveling with someone else, there is often a need to compromise and come to a consensus about what activities to do and how much time to spend at each location. While this can be enjoyable and can lead to new experiences, it can also be frustrating if I have a specific list of things that I want to do and see. When I am traveling alone, I have the freedom to do exactly what I want and go at my own pace.\\nAnother reason I prefer to travel alone is that it allows me to fully immerse myself in the experience of being in a new place.

When I am alone, I have the opportunity to truly take in everything that a new place has to offer and fully engage with the culture and people around me.\\nThere are, of course, also benefits to traveling with a companion. For example, it can be more enjoyable to have someone to share the experience with, and it can also be safer to have someone with you in case of any emergencies. Additionally, traveling with a companion can be more cost-effective as you can split the cost of accommodations and transportation.\\nUltimately, whether to travel with a companion or alone is a personal decision that depends on an individual's preferences and circumstances. For me, the benefits of having control over my itinerary and the opportunity to fully immerse myself in the experience of being in a new place make traveling alone the better choice.\"\n",

Some people argue that children should begin their formal education at a very early age and spend most of their time on school studies, while others believe that young children should have the opportunity to spend most of their time playing and exploring their surroundings.\\nThose who advocate for early formal education argue that it is important for children to get a head start on their education in order to be academically successful later in life. They believe that starting formal education at a young age allows children to develop strong academic skills and knowledge at an early age, which can lead to better performance in school and in their future careers.\\nOn the other hand, those who believe that young children should spend most of their time playing argue that play is an essential part of a child's development. They believe that play allows children to develop important social skills, such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. Play also allows children to learn about their interests and passions, which can help guide their future academic and career choices.\\nIn my opinion, both approaches have merit and it is important to strike a balance between structured learning and play. While it is important for children to develop strong academic skills, it is also important for them to have the opportunity to explore their interests and to develop their social and emotional skills.\\nOne approach that combines both structured learning and play is the Montessori method, which focuses on allowing children to learn at their own pace and to explore their interests through hands-on activities and play. This approach has been shown to be effective in promoting academic success and social and emotional development in young children.\\nIn conclusion, while both early formal education and play have their benefits, it is important to find a balance between the two in order to promote both academic success and social and emotional development in young children.\"\n",
            " \"Some people claim that universities should give the same sum of money to their students' sports activities as to their university libraries. They point out that universities should attract more students to exercise, because a healthy body can make a student bear the heavy studies. On the other hand, most people, like me, strongly disagree with it. In the following paragraphs, I will explain some main reasons.\\nIn the first place, an obvious advantage to spend more money on libraries is that enormous libraries can help us save a huge amount of money, paper resource and the time to seek study materials from a far bookstore. As we all known, the prices of books are more expensive than before, while we have to read more books to catch up with the high-tech era. Moreover, now many students are still too poor to go to school, therefore libraries become the cheapest places to provide useful knowledge for them. Just imagine these poor persons can enjoy varieties of books in a comfortable environment with enough light and a quiet study atmosphere. How happy they are!\\nSecondly, another reason why I disagree is that the chief goal of university education is to teach students working skills. Obviously, libraries provide more useful information to students than sports activities do. For example, more and more libraries are also equipped with computers, which can encourage students to surf the Net to widen their horizons. Without the Internet, there will be fewer chances to make friend with the foreigners and catch the latest worldwide information. On the contrary, sports activities are just limited in a small area and a few of friends in some degree.\\nHowever, I don not deny that sports activities can provide chances to develop some good characteristics, such as cooperation. But frankly speaking, it is a bit wasteful to spend too much money on sports activities, when we can attain enough free exercises, such as running, which gain the same advantages as well. Furthermore, students are easily obsessed by the activities and overlook their studies. For instant, I once used so much study time to play basketball that I failed to go up to the next grade. Although I earned some awards of basketball matches at that time, I feel very regret. In fact, numerous students have the similar stories because of the attraction of the sports activities.\\nIn conclusion, I firmly disagree with the idea that universities should give the same sum of money to their students' sports activities as they give to their university libraries. Nevertheless we are sure that both universities libraries and proper sports activities are valuable. Anyway, to avoid students playing overtime and ignoring their homework should be concerned. Is it wise to spend more money on universities libraries?\"\n",

Both approaches have their own benefits and drawbacks, and which one a person prefers often depends on their personality, values, and life circumstances.\\nThose who enjoy change and look forward to new experiences tend to be more open-minded and adventurous. They embrace the unknown and embrace new opportunities as they come. This approach to life can lead to exciting and enriching experiences, as well as personal growth and self-discovery. It can also be a source of stress and uncertainty, as change can bring with it risks and challenges.\\nOn the other hand, those who prefer stability and maintaining their usual habits may value predictability and routine. They may find comfort in the familiar and may not enjoy stepping outside their comfort zone. This approach to life can provide a sense of security and stability, but it can also lead to a lack of growth and stagnation.\\nPersonally, I prefer a balance between the two approaches. While I enjoy trying new things and experiencing new things, I also value stability and routine in certain areas of my life.

            " 'I agree with the statement that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. There are several reasons why this is the case.\\nFirst, difficult experiences often involve challenges that push us out of our comfort zone and help us to grow as individuals. For example, if we are faced with a difficult decision, we may have to confront our own biases and limitations in order to make the best choice. This process of self-reflection and self-improvement can be difficult, but it is also invaluable in helping us to become more self-aware and capable of handling future challenges.\\nSecond, difficult experiences can also teach us valuable lessons about resilience and perseverance. When we face challenges, we are often forced to find ways to adapt and overcome them, which can help to build our strength and determination. For example, if we face a difficult setback in our careers, we may have to find ways to bounce back and keep moving forward. This process of overcoming adversity can be tough, but it can also help us to develop the skills and mindset we need to thrive in the face of future challenges.\\nFinally, difficult experiences can also help us to appreciate the good things in our lives. When we face difficult times, it can be easy to focus on the negatives and lose sight of the many blessings we have. However, by working through difficult experiences and coming out on the other side, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the things that truly matter to us, such as our relationships, our health, and our sense of purpose.\\nIn conclusion, I believe that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. These experiences can help us to grow as individuals, develop resilience and determination, and appreciate the good things in our lives.'\n",
            " 'Nowadays, a lot of teens work in jobs while they are studying. Some of them really need the money they earn to compensate for their school expenses whereas others use the money they earn as pocket money. Whatever the reason for the students to work in jobs is, in my opinion, working is a great experience to all. Having a job is an important opportunity to learn about responsibilities and also teaches the teenagers to cooperate with their co-workers and enable them to understand the value of money.\\nTo start with, working in a job gives teenagers lots of situations in which they should act responsibly; otherwise they will lose their jobs. For example, one has to wake up early if his/her working hours start at 8:00 AM in the morning, no matter how late he/she stayed up last night. Otherwise, his/her supervisor will warn him/her or may eventually fire the individual.\\nA second reason why having jobs as students has positive effects on teenagers is that it teaches them how to cooperate and the importance of cooperation. In a work setting usually the employees have to depend on each other on numerous occasions. When a single employee loafs, others will have to compensate for his/her workload in addition to their own tasks. Students will learn from their working experience the importance of cooperation and why every individual should effectively carry out his/her own work.\\nAnother point is, these working possibilities enable the students to understand the value of money and that \"Money does not grow on trees\". After the student sees how hard he/she has to work to earn money, he/she will also be more reasonable while spending it, thus, his/her purchasing behavior will be enhanced.\\nIn conclusion, when one has a job as a student, he/she will benefit significantly from the experience. This way, students will be more responsible when they graduate. Furthermore, they will be more cooperative, thus will be more beneficial for the companies they will be working in once they will be graduated. Finally, since they\\'ll know better how to spend their money, they won\\'t get into trouble due to excessive spending. All in all, having jobs as students is a terrific idea and I think every student should have a working experience before graduating and starting their professional careers.'\n",
            " 'The announcement of a large shopping center being built in my neighborhood has sparked a debate among residents. While some see it as a convenient addition to the community, others worry about the potential negative impacts it could have. Personally, I oppose the plan to build a shopping center in my neighborhood.\\nOne reason I oppose the shopping center is that it could increase traffic and congestion in the area. With more people coming to the shopping center, there will be more cars on the road, which could lead to longer commute times and more difficulty finding parking. This could be especially problematic for those who live near the shopping center and may have to deal with the added traffic on a daily basis.\\nIn addition, the shopping center could also have negative impacts on local businesses. While the new shopping center may bring in some new customers, it could also take business away from smaller, locally owned stores in the area. These stores are often an integral part of the community and contribute to its unique character. Losing them could have a detrimental effect on the neighborhood.\\nFurthermore, the shopping center could also lead to environmental issues. The construction of the shopping center itself would likely result in the destruction of natural habitats and the release of greenhouse gases. The shopping center would also contribute to the problem of overconsumption and waste, as it would encourage people to buy more products that may eventually end up in landfills.\\nOverall, while the addition of a shopping center may seem convenient at first glance, there are several potential negative impacts that I believe outweigh the benefits. For these reasons, I oppose the plan to build a shopping center in my neighborhood.'\n",
            " \"Advertising is an all-powerful tool in today’s world where communication means are varied and accessible by all, and reaching the target audience with the right message makes all the difference. Advertising is a medium through which, people can be educated about a particular issue at hand. Advertising can be about a new product, a new business opportunity or in this case about a country. I strongly agree with the statement that advertising can inform, educate and can tell a lot about the country. I will support my argument through examples and reasoning given below.\\nAdvertising can be of many forms: Printed and published information, through broadcast media (radio and television) and now the most important emerging means of all; that of the Internet. All these forms of advertising have their own advantages and disadvantages. Advertising is generally responsible for the first impressions of a country in people's minds. In this case, what they hear about a particular country for the first time through any means of advertising, will result in it being a true picture of a country for that person / country.\\nSo that's the reasons why governments of some developed countries have taken this issue of projecting the right image of their country through advertising very seriously. This is proven by the fact that their tourism numbers and advantages of living and working in their country are most highlighted than other countries. This is nonetheless important in today’s competitive global environment where countries are competing against each other to attract new investments and business in their country. All this directly affects the economic and development scene of the country as good or bad advertising can directly result in the country's growth.\\nFor instance, in my country India, the Information technology ministry has spent substantial finances and efforts to highlight India's advantage as a global source for information technology workers. This in fact has resulted in growth in the Gross Domestic Product of our country there by raising the standard of people living in this country and giving ancient industry a chance to grow in a free capital environment. This couldn’t have been achieved without concentrated advertising of our advantages and economic benefits of developing software in India.\\nSo I conclude to say that Advertising cannot only tell a lot about a country but can also result in bring growth to the economy and prosperity to its people. Adding to that, I would like every government of the world taking efforts to promote the best their county has to give to the world, here by promoting peace and prosperity among all nations.\"\n",
            " 'In our world there are many different customs that differ from one country to another. My country has one that, in my opinion, can be adopted by many other countries. My country inhabitants called it \"Martisor\". In spring, people give each other a gift of a white and red piece of string, which means revival of the environment.\\nOne of my reasons is that this custom is symbol of life and health. In our competitive world, when we often forget to enjoy the simplest things in our life such as flowers, trees, fresh air, walking with friends and family, or in other words have a good time, \"Martisor\" is not a simple gift. Our life is very complicated and stressful. Therefore, in my opinion, this custom will benefit to all people all over the world.\\nAnother important reason is that one can make a lot of friends by giving them his inexpensive gift. Also, he can make it by himself because it is very easy to make and you do not need special acknowledge how to make it. For example, I feel very happy when somebody gives me such a gift. This is not because I like surprises. When somebody give you a gift, this means he is proud of you, he love you, or even he want to make you happy, to see your smile or a look in your eyes.\\nIn conclusion, I can say that if I had an opportunity to choose one custom, I would select \"Martisor\" because everybody can make a lot of friends enjoying life and having a good time by giving them this symbol of life and health.\\n'\n",
            " 'We meet strangers on a daily basis. We meet them when waiting for the bus, queuing up at the bank or even when having lunch at a restaurant. For most people, they often form an opinion on the people they meet the minute they meet. Their basis for this act is that \\'first impression is always right\\'. Nonetheless, how true is this statement? Humans are complex creatures, thus, it is impossible to dissect them in just one minute. Therefore, though occasionally first impression may be right, most of the time they are not as knowing a person inside out is never an easy process.\\nShrek in \\'Shrek\\' quoted \"Just like onions, I have layers\". So true is that remark that each layer is different from the other. Humans are like that too. We have feelings and emotions, which not all of them are displayed in a single day. This in turn making the process of friendship a lengthy one. Therefore, to trust first impressions is obviously a silly act, as human characters are only fully understood only after a certain period of time.\\nIn addition to that, moods also play an important role when we judge a person. Humans, as we all know, have their ups and downs and this often affect their judgment if they are not able to control it. The same goes when judging another person. When the mood is right, we might see everybody around us as saints and angels who really make our day. However, imagine when we had a bad day at work, even the nice considerate waiter might seem pushy.\\nNevertheless, there could be another group of people who trust their instincts, and stand by it. These groups might argue that first impressions are based on instincts, and as instincts are subconsciously based on past experience, hence, first impressions are reliable. Their point is arguably true, but can anybody actually determine the amount of experience needed to ensure that the instinct is correct? Surely, nobody can.\\nIn conclusion, humans are the most complex animals on the face of the earth. Just as much as we like to believe that we all feel happy for the same joyous moments, feel pain for same suffering, the truth is, it is not so. This is because we have different characteristics that differ us from one another. Therefore, as the saying \"never judge a book by its cover\", we should not fully trust in first impressions as it is not only cruel, but also unfair to the person we judge.'\n",
            " 'There are pros and cons to both eating at food stands or restaurants and preparing and eating food at home. Personally, I prefer to prepare and eat food at home for several reasons.\\nOne reason I prefer to eat at home is the cost. While eating out can be a convenient option, it can also be more expensive than cooking at home. By cooking at home, I am able to control my budget and spend less on food overall. I can also choose to use cheaper ingredients or leftovers to stretch my food budget further.\\nAnother reason I prefer eating at home is the control it gives me over my food choices. When eating out, I am limited to the menu options available at the restaurant or food stand. However, when I prepare my own food at home, I have the ability to choose exactly what I want to eat and can tailor my meals to my specific tastes and dietary restrictions.\\nFurthermore, eating at home allows me the opportunity to cook in a healthier manner. I can control the amount of oil, salt, and sugar used in my meals and can opt for healthier ingredients. I can also portion my meals properly, rather than being served large restaurant portions that may be too much for me to consume.\\nFinally, eating at home allows for a more relaxed and enjoyable dining experience. I can choose to eat in the comfort of my own home, surrounded by familiar surroundings and without the noise and crowds often found in restaurants. I can also take my time and savor my meals without feeling rushed.\\nOverall, while there are certainly advantages to eating at food stands or restaurants, I prefer to prepare and eat food at home due to the cost savings, control over my food choices, ability to eat healthier, and more relaxed dining experience.'\n",
            " 'Internet as we all know is changing the way we live our lives in the new millennium. Never before in the history of mankind, was so much information available to people. So with this abundance of information, also come the clashes of views. Some people believe that this medium provides people with lot of information, while others stand by the view that this excess of information creates problems. In my opinion, the information provided by the Internet is valuable to people and can help us solve a lot of problems which is faced by the world today. It can also serve as people voice against corrupt governments and make them aware of their rights to freedom and expression of free speech.\\nInternet because of its distributed nature is very free in nature. By free, I mean that anyone and everyone with a view can express it on the Internet. This is best described by the journalists and other social workers that can break the news of war, conflict or any epidemic almost immediately as it occurs. Previously, governments used to control the flow of information. But now due to the advent of the Internet, every piece of news and developments in news stories can be broadcasted live over the Internet. This valuable information is transmitted over the Internet over a medium, which knows no limits or boundaries. This helps in bringing people closer and promises that the message will be delivered to the world in an uncensored form. This principle very much supports the view that this is a free world, which is made possible due to the medium of Internet.\\nAnother nature of the Internet is that, it is non- proprietary and no one can claim ownership or copyright over it. This establishes an ideal medium for people to exhibit their work. Best examples of these are the students at university, music artists, scientists researching on a new product or path-breaking discovery. With so much information freely available, people can be well informed of their alternatives available to them. Like for example, I read in a news article that a woman in Africa was suffering from a rare form of cancer. The doctors in Africa had given up hope. Then one of the doctors had read over the Internet about a new revolutionary treatment for this cancer being developed by some Canadian doctors. So after some more research and communication over the Internet with the Canadian team of doctors, the women were flown to Canada, where she was treated for the cancer. Thus, a life was saved because information was available in time.\\nSo I believe that Internet provides people with a lot of valuable information, which in most cases is life saving or sometimes is educating to people. But I would also like to add that with this access of information comes responsibility. So individuals and governments should respect the value of information and use it in ethical ways so as not to cause damage.'\n",
            " 'I agree that modern technology is creating a single world culture because it disseminates knowledge beyond the geographic borders of a location. When people communicate they exchange ideas and feelings. In the ancient era, culture was passed from parents to children by spoken language. Knowledge, traditions and beliefs were transferred to the youngest through speaking and in some cases writing or drawing. Thus, at that time, culture was very restricted to the tribe, village or the community were they lived.\\nThe modern means of transportation, in my opinion, was the first invention that contributed strongly to the spread of cultures throughout the planet. The advance of automobiles, airplanes and ships made incredibly easier to be in other parts of the planet. People started to know more about other cultures and many times introducing to their own culture things learned in other places and countries. The exchange of knowledge and goods started to play an important role in people’s life. The café from Brazil, the scotch from Scotland, the cigars from Cuba, the wine from France, the American music, are good examples of how other countries products are rooted in our day-by-day life and our culture.\\nFurthermore, in the past few years we have experienced a new wave of technology. Internet, mobile phones, email, e-commerce, are some words that resume what is present in our quotidian. As never before was so easy to communicate to one another. Consequently the world is creating a whole new definition of culture. It is the culture of mass that transcends the geographical borders, permitting that you feel at home anywhere in the planet. The people’s behavior and architecture has been standardized either. Picture yourself, for instance, in a hotel room in Japan, Rio de Janeiro or New York. In most cases you will receive the same treatment in all those places and the interior designs all look the same, as the services provided. The reason they do this is to make everyone fell as he was in his own hometown, not mattering where you are from.\\nIn conclusion, modern technology has facilitated our lives enormously. But the price paid for the advancement of technology is that some countries, if they do not stand hard at their beliefs and traditions, they will lose their identity to absorb the globalize culture.\\n'\n",
            " 'Many people believe that one can be successful if he /she is committed, honest, faithful or intelligence. But, the foundation of each of these qualities lies in believing the power the person has, and working accordingly to achieve the goal. There are many people, who are honest, beautiful, good and soft spoken, intelligent and even faithful, but only some are successful in achieving their goal. While all of these characteristics are equally important and act as the medium for success, the most important is the power to cope with circumstances and keep our spirit goes on in the most difficult situations.\\nAs it is well said that we cannot direct the wind but we can adjust the sail, similarly, in the way to our destination, we will come across lot of obstacles, but we need to find the way to come across that situation. This is where the success lies. No matter how low we fall, but what matters is how high we bounce back Success can be measured by what we have and how much of the power we are using to achieve our goal. For, example while in playing games, it is sure that one team will win and other will lose, but the spirit is not just in winning but also in learning new techniques and improving the team sprit and cooperation. Winner team cannot always be successful, but the successful team is the one, which has improved a lot with respect to its earlier performance.\\nThough the person is honest, intelligent, faithful and committed, it is not sure that he will be successful. The most important rather than these are to know the environment and the need, and implementing best of the best ideas and actions. No matter how smaller step it can be, but it can bring great changes. As Shiva Khera has said, “Winners don’t do different things but they do things differently”, better explains the meaning of being successful. Success is not just winning, but also more than that is how much we are satisfied with whatever we are doing. So, all qualities like honesty, intelligence, and faithfulness are directly proportional to the success.\\nThe definition of success for each of us may vary. Some may think root cause for success is honesty while others may think it is the commitment. But, in my opinion, where there is will there is power, so each of us should know our strength, and work accordingly to be successful. And we should measure our success not with others but with what we have and what we have achieved.'\n",

            " \"Students are often able to choose whether they want to live in a dormitory, on a university campus, or in a separate apartment in the community. Each of these environments has its advantages. In this essay I will present some of the facts that support both solutions, and I will argue in favor of living in an apartment.\\nLiving in dorm offers a chance to improve communication skills, to learn to live with other people. For example, roommates must adjust their eating and sleeping habits according to each other's needs. Each one must arrange his free time in such way that he doesn't bother others while they are studying. Moreover, the social structure of the dorm community is in many aspects similar to that of a typical office, or workplace in general. Both environments require finding solutions to various problems and cooperation of the people in order to achieve that. Thus, by adapting to conditions of living in the dormitory, students actually prepare themselves for their future jobs. The environment in the dorm is friendlier and understanding, because it is consisted of other students, who often have similar problems and interests. The social life is more interesting, too. For example, if students failed to understand a lecture as it was presented in class, he can ask his friends from the dorm for an explanation. Also, it’s much easier to find a common topic to chat about, or an interesting activity to practice in free time.\\nOn the other hand, living in separate apartment usually means having less neighbors and roommates. In fact, it is not a rare case that a student has whole apartment for himself. In this situation, there is less distraction, so students can concentrate better on their schoolwork. As a consequence, their grades are better. Another advantage is that living alone means having more privacy. This aspect is very important, because everyone has personal secrets, which he wants to hide from all other people, even the closest friends. Finally, students who live in the apartments can maintain contacts with their neighbors, ordinary people, and are not confined to academic community. This way, students are offered a wider variety of experiences from everyday life, which they may find useful in their future lives.\\nIf I were in a situation to choose whether I would live in the dormitory or have a separate apartment, I would choose to live in separate apartment. It could be argued that living separately narrows one's circle of close friends, precluding him from having regular contacts with other people. This argument goes on to assert that such students are deprived of social experiences, and therefore remain aloof and introvert. However, it is a fact that students can make enough friends even if they live outside of the university campus, especially if the apartment is shared between several students. Furthermore, friends can visit each other as often as they need to. They can maintain friendly contact in a way, which doesn't affect their school performance. Careful planning and wise distribution of time can achieve this. If a student assigns enough time for studying, his grades won't suffer, and he will still be able to spend the remaining time with his friends. Alternatively, students who live in a school dormitory are constantly surrounded with familiar people. They can't avoid excessive socializing, even if they want to. Therefore, they spend too little time studying and they get low grades.\\nIn conclusion, living in the dormitory may be more interesting and socially challenging, but it's rather unsuitable for serious studying. Living in an apartment, however, allows a student to socialize, but only to the extent that doesn't affect his schoolwork negatively. This way, positive effects of living both in dormitory and in an apartment are obtained.\"\n",
            " \"Can knowledge of the past be beneficial for those of us living in the present? Some people think this information is useless, others believe it's significant. The former consider it obsolete. Although significant portion of the past knowledge can't be directly applied to the present day, learning about the past creates opportunities for scientific discoveries, prevents from repeating mistakes of the past, and contributes to the understanding of the purpose of our existence. Technological progress is induced by new scientific discoveries that would never occur without knowledge of prior achievements in the certain scientific field. Major innovations occurring in the industry are based on new scientific theories put into practice. Discovery of micro particles - electrons, protons and neutrons- in Physics revealed the possibility of creating the flow of electrons under the influence of the magnetic field. Every production process today is based on this latter discovery of electric current, which wouldn't be made without past knowledge of electrons existence.\\nBesides providing knowledge of fundamental discoveries, past experience helps prevent reoccurrence of negative events in the history of our civilization. School children learn about world wars cited in the history textbooks so that when they grow up they don't repeat mistakes of their predecessors. One of the brightest examples is atomic bomb dropped on Japan during World War the Second. Knowledge of such negative experiences is necessary for humanity to continue its existence.\\nMoreover, learning about the past helps satisfy people's desire to understand who they are and why they exist. History and Religion are necessary for a discussion of these main philosophical questions. If people haven't been learning about the past, Bible texts, which give answers to these questions, would never be preserved till the present day. In the same time Bible is the main guide for majority of the world population today.\\nConsequently, it's imperative to learn about the past, because this knowledge is valuable for the development of our civilization. Technological progress, avoidance of past mistakes, and contribution to understanding of the purpose of existence can only be achieved through understanding of our predecessors' lives and deeds.\"\n",
            " \"I strongly agree that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. There are several reasons why this is an important and beneficial decision for children.\\nFirst and foremost, learning a foreign language at an early age has been shown to have numerous cognitive benefits. It has been found that children who study a foreign language tend to perform better on standardized tests, have improved memory and problem-solving skills, and even score higher on verbal and math sections of the SAT. These benefits are likely due to the fact that learning a foreign language requires the development of new neural connections, which helps to improve overall brain function.\\nIn addition to the cognitive benefits, learning a foreign language at a young age can also have social and cultural benefits. Children who are exposed to different languages and cultures at an early age tend to be more open-minded and accepting of other cultures, which can be valuable in today's increasingly globalized world. Children who speak more than one language also have an advantage when it comes to future job opportunities, as being bilingual or multilingual is often viewed as a valuable skill in many industries.\\nThere are also practical benefits to starting foreign language learning at an early age. Children tend to be more receptive to learning new languages when they are young, and they often find it easier to pick up new languages than adults do. This means that they can make progress more quickly and achieve a higher level of proficiency in a shorter amount of time.\\nIn conclusion, I believe that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. The cognitive, social, and practical benefits of doing so make it a valuable investment in a child's future.\"\n",
            " \"I totally disagree with the statement that decisions that people make immediately are always wrong. Some decisions need to be made after careful thought, while some decisions have to be made immediately due to the limit of time.\\nIn the real life, people don't always have enough time to think about what kind of decisions they need to make and how many options they have in order to reach the optimum result. Time does restrain people from making decision after careful of thought. The first case happens in the stock exchange market. The price of stock changes every minute, even every second. The brokers need to make immediate decision to buy or sell. If they spend a long time on making decision, they will lose chance to make a lot of money, the stocks will never be available when they make final decisions. Even though quick decisions might make brokers to lose some money, but there are still 50% chance to make much money. If they don't make a quick decision and miss the chance, they will never make money. So from this case, we can conclude that immediate decisions are not always wrong.\\nAnother case comes from sports. During the soccer game, the team members usually have been assigned duties and given strategies before the game by the coaches. But during the last 5 minutes, two teams have the same score, one of team must win this game so that they are eligible to attend the semi-final, at the same time the coach of this team has no more chance to give his team member more suggestions. Therefore, the team members need to change their old strategies on their own so that they will have chance to win. But if members take more time than 5 minutes to make decision, they might make a best decision, but this best decision won't work at all since time is up. They will absolutely lose the chance to win. However, if they make a quick decision, it is very possible for them to win this game and get into the semi-final.\\nFrom the above two cases, we can conclude that the statement that decisions that people make immediately are always wrong is not right. Sometimes people need to take the chance to make decision immediately so that they can gain something instead of completely losing.\"\n",

Additionally, large companies often offer a wider range of benefits and opportunities for professional development and advancement. For example, they may have more resources to invest in employee training and development programs, and may have a larger number of management positions available for advancement.\\nOn the other hand, working for a small company can also have its benefits. Small companies often have a more intimate and collaborative work environment, which can be more enjoyable for some people. Additionally, small companies may offer more flexibility in terms of work schedules and the ability to have a greater impact on the direction of the company. For those who prefer a more hands-on approach to their work and enjoy being able to see the results of their efforts, a small company may be a better fit.\\nIn my opinion, I would prefer to work for a large company.

            " \"Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. I disagree with this point of view for several reasons, which I will detail in this essay.\\nThere are two reasons that support this view. The first reason is that all the creatures on the face of the earth have the same right to exist, be it a four-legged animal or a human, both have the same right--just because humans have more so-called intelligence than do animals doesn't necessarily mean that they are naturally entitled to use any land as they wish.\\nThe second reason is that for the existence of humans on earth, the existence of other creatures is essential. I say this because the presence of all the animals is essential to maintain natural order. We have seen the consequences of upsetting this balance in many environmental problems such as global warming.\\nFurthermore, animals are a necessary part of our lives on Earth. For example consider the food chain of the rat, snake, and eagle. We know that certain types of eagles are endangered species. If the eagle is hunted to the point where it becomes non-existent, then the food chain will be broken. As a result of this, the number of snakes will increase. This will result in greater environmental problems and could harm the lives of humans.\\nIf the endangered animals are not protected the existence of humans will be in danger. Our history has shown that if we continue to exploit our resources, particularly by destroying the land and therefore the natural habitat of plants and animals, we will ultimately harm ourselves. Therefore, I believe it is vital for people to preserve land in its natural state.\"\n",
            " 'Today almost everybody has a telephone and a computer, which is connected to the Internet. These inventions has some positive sides-especially when we should talk to a person who is a long distance away from us; nevertheless they have one negative side -they make communications between people less personal.\\nWhen I was a child neither we have a telephone, nor a computer connected to the Internet. Now we have both. However, I do not use them very much in order to communicate. I am not used to making a telephone call or sending e-mail yet. I would rather speak directly with the person I want to. In this way, I could see his or her reaction to what I say and thus it is easier to talk. Actually, this is the reason why people prefer to talk in person rather than using a telephone.\\nThe other popular way to communicate is via sending e-mails. This, according to me, is the least personal way for communicating and the hardest way, as well. When we send an e-mail we sometimes either have not seen this person, or we do not know anything about him. Therefore, we cannot easily choose what to write him. Another thing that makes this kind of communication so impersonal is the e-mails, which are sent when we became members to an Internet site. These e-mails are sent to every member and text is the same.\\nAll at all, e-mails and telephones make communications impersonal. Thus, for some people it is very difficult to communicate in this way. I hope that when further advancements of these technologies are made this problem will be solved.'\n",
            " 'Some people think that businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. In my opinion, these people are thinking a little bit selfish, because there are other things that a business should do, for example considering the workers, costumers. Beside all these a business should serve the community.\\nThe most important thing to realize is that, a person who is serving the costumers and the community should always be honest. In my opinion honesty is the most important quality a business should have in order to deserve the profit it makes. Earning money by playing trick on consumers or getting more money than it deserves is so bad that I don’t think a business which makes profit out of dishonesty can carry on with success. In a business all the workers must consider the other workers, the costumers and the community they live in. Colleagues are also very important; they should respect each other and should never forget that business is teamwork. If a business is making large profits, it should share it with the people who made that profit possible. If a worker cannot get what he deserves either economically or mentally he may not be able to work effectively in the future.\\nThe other important thing is that some of the profits one’s business earns from the community should be returned to the community. For example if big company is earning a lot of money, it should never forget that the money comes from community so it should return some of the profit back to community. There are various ways to do it. For example a company can built a park for the children or crèche just like public nursery for the children of the workers, get the trust of the workers.\\nThe last very important point is to get customers’ trust. A small company may grow into a large company after sometime but if it wants to be long lasting, it should always try to produce high-quality products, and give good service to its costumers.\\nGenerally, it can be said that the most important thing for a business is to make a profit; a business should never do anything to make a large profit. There are more important things such as serving the costumers, workers and community .A business must make profits, but we all - workers, customers, community- must profit from a successful business.'\n",
            " \"Success is a subjective concept that can be defined in a variety of ways. While some people may define success as earning a lot of money, others may define it in terms of personal fulfillment, relationships, or making a positive impact on the world. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that only people who earn a lot of money are successful.\\nOne reason why this statement is not true is that success is not necessarily tied to financial wealth. Many people find success in their personal lives through meaningful relationships, good health, and a sense of purpose and fulfillment. For example, a person who has a strong network of supportive friends and family, is physically and mentally healthy, and is passionate about their hobbies and interests may consider themselves successful, even if they do not earn a high income.\\nFurthermore, success is often measured by one's impact on the world, not just by their financial wealth. Many people who make a significant contribution to society, such as scientists, educators, and activists, may not earn a high income but are still considered successful because of the positive impact they have had on the world.\\nIn addition, the idea that only people who earn a lot of money are successful ignores the many other factors that contribute to an individual's financial success. Hard work, education, and opportunity all play a role in an individual's ability to earn a high income. It is not fair to say that someone who has not had the same opportunities or access to education as someone else is any less successful simply because they do not earn as much money.\\nIn conclusion, the statement that only people who earn a lot of money are successful is not accurate. Success can be measured in many different ways, including personal fulfillment, relationships, and impact on the world, and is not solely dependent on financial wealth. There are many other factors that contribute to an individual's financial success, and it is not fair to judge someone's success solely based on their income.\"\n",
            " \"There are pros and cons to both doing work by hand and using machines. Personally, I prefer using machines because they can be more efficient and precise.\\nOne reason I prefer using machines is that they can complete tasks much faster than if they were done by hand. For example, a machine can sew a garment much faster than a person could with a needle and thread. This is especially useful in industries where time is a critical factor, such as in mass production or when meeting tight deadlines.\\nAnother reason I prefer using machines is that they can be more precise than human hands. For example, a machine can cut materials with perfect accuracy, whereas a person using hand tools may have a harder time achieving the same level of precision. This is especially important in fields such as manufacturing, where precision is crucial in creating high-quality products.\\nHowever, there are also valid arguments for doing work by hand. One reason is that it can be more satisfying and rewarding to create something with your own hands. There is a certain level of pride that comes with knowing that you have created something entirely by yourself. Additionally, doing work by hand can be more tactile and immersive, allowing you to fully engage with the task at hand.\\nIn conclusion, while there are benefits to both doing work by hand and using machines, I personally prefer using machines because they can be more efficient and precise. However, I do recognize that there are also valid arguments for doing work by hand, and it ultimately depends on the task and the individual's preferences.\"\n",

Kolkata is the city of my birth and no doubt it is my favorite city. Kolkata, like many other metropolitan cities, has a number of features, some of which will really attract newcomers while others will keep them away.\\nKolkata is a city that is full of life. Here, unlike any other city in India, people are cooperative and one can enjoy one's joy and happiness in company of others. In Kolkata, help is always available, even if one does not ask for it. This is really a unique feature of Kolkata, which makes it a different city. One can enjoy the festivals to the full extent of one's desire. During the festivals people come closer, even if they are not known to each other. It is the mood during the festivals, which brings all the Kolkata together.\\nSimilarly, people are also available to share each other's sorrow and grief. Here, one will always find a company if he/she searches for solace and comfort. If someone is in distress people are always available to help him/her whatever may be the time of the day. Kolkata is a lively city. One will not feel the live ness of Kolkata unless he or she resides here.\\nHowever, in spite of the liveliness of Kolkata, it has some features that may upset a newcomer. One of these is the crowd. The roads here are quite crowded as are the buses on the roads. Its really difficult for a newcomer to get adjusted to these crowded roads. To walk on these roads people have to jostle one another's arms and tramp each other’s feet. There is a great rush on the roads during the peak hours and a lot of traffic congestion. As a result people are always late in reaching their destinations. Here, the number of vehicles passing through the roads is greater in comparison to the number of roads available, which results in traffic congestion.\\nSo, a person who is planning to move to my city will like all its advantages but dislike all its disadvantages. However, even though Kolkata has a number of drawbacks and suffers from a lot of disadvantages, still it is my favorite city and will always be.\"\n",
            " 'A greater number of people are now hitting the eighty-year mark than ten years ago. In fact, the life expectancy of the average human has gone up considerably, and is rising still. This phenomenon is the result of several reasons. For one, continuing scientific and medical innovation ensure that more people receive the treatment they require. As our knowledge grows regarding various diseases, we become better equipped to tackle them. Consequently, we have managed to eradicate some diseases on a global scale, while controlling the other diseases, so that the rate of mortality does not reach an alarming height during the outbreak of a disease. The plagues of yore, as well as the more recent plague outbreaks are becoming few and far in between. Such control of diseases means that the general life expectancy has gone up.\\nDiseases such as cancer, which used to result almost inevitably in death, are now curable, provided they are diagnosed at a certain stage. Diseases such as tuberculosis and cholera now cause fewer deaths than they used to only a few decades ago. Another reason for the greater life expectancy is the general betterment of the quality of life. What we call the ‘global village’ is fast becoming a city. And in this city, more and more people are being provided a better level of hygiene than ever before. A better and improving system of communication ensures that the latest medical discoveries in the United States and Europe are known all over the world in a space of a few days. Therefore, more and more people have access to better health care. Even people living in relatively remote areas have access to some kind of medical facilities. Though these facilities may be incapable of handling a crisis, they may help prevent death in cases that require antibiotics and antivenin, thereby preventing death by infection or poison.\\nThe increase in awareness also means that people in general are becoming more aware of the risks of various diseases. For instance, more people now, than two decades ago, are aware of the scourge of cholesterol and the havoc it wreaks on an individual’s circulatory system. Similarly people are becoming aware that prevention is, after all, better than cure and are taking the appropriate steps to prevent infection from diseases.\\nIn general, though, the increased life expectancy owes much to the revolution in communication. It may be mentioned that even two hundred years ago, inventions and discoveries were being made. However, they did few people any good. It simply took too long to disseminate the information. The general level of awareness regarding health was also low. However, it has been noticed that since the inception of communication through first print, and then radio and television, the level of awareness regarding health has generally risen. To illustrate, print facilitated the spread of knowledge through books. Radio helped bring that knowledge to many people. Television helped to further this knowledge and disseminate is amongst an even greater number of people. And finally, the Internet has removed the final barriers between intercultural and interracial communication. In the coming years, we may hope to see an even greater increase in life expectancy, even as communication techniques continue to improve.'\n",
            " 'All means of transportation should be kept in good conditions. However, I believe it would be most beneficial for a country or city, if its government spent more money on improving public transportation. This would result in substantial standard of living improvements.\\nThe volume of cars and trucks hitting the highways is dramatically rising every year. As a result, the number of traffic jams, accidents and carbon monoxide emissions are doing too. All these factors have a detrimental effect on our quality of life. Expanding subway lines and railroads and developing an effective plan to combine buses and subways routes, would eventually lead to a reduction in pollution levels, less traffic jams and less stress for the people.\\nIf subway lines reached every corner of a city, people would not need to use their cars to commute. Less cars on the road, means less carbon monoxide emissions into the atmosphere; therefore, the air we breathe would be more pure. Less cars also means less traffic jams, which translates into less stress for drivers and better living conditions.\\nNot every country has a well-developed railroad system. Consequently, they have to rely on trucks and buses for ground transportation of passengers and freight. Expanding and upgrading railroad systems will result in fewer trucks and buses on the highways. Removing this kind of traffic from the highways and encouraging the use of trains, would be another way to reduce congestion on the freeways. The reduction of traffic represents less maintenance costs for the government. This surplus of money could be use for other purposes. For example, a forest recovery program or a national campaign against pollution.\\nHighways, roads and public transportation all require maintenance funds, but I think it is more important to think about the future and how to make our countries or cities better places to live in. Improving public transportation will help reduce traffic jams, accidents and air pollution. A safer, healthier and more enjoyable place to live waits for us in the future.'\n",

This statement is one that I fully agree with, as dancing has many important functions within a culture and can provide a variety of benefits for those who participate in it.\\nOne reason why dancing is important in a culture is that it serves as a form of artistic expression. Through dance, people can communicate their feelings, emotions, and ideas in a way that words alone cannot. Dance can also be used to tell stories, whether they be historical, mythological, or personal. This allows individuals to connect with their culture and heritage in a meaningful way.\\nAnother reason why dancing is important in a culture is that it can bring people together. Dance often involves group participation, whether it be in the form of a traditional folk dance or a modern hip hop performance. This shared experience can foster a sense of community and belonging, as people come together to celebrate and enjoy their culture.\\nIn addition to these cultural benefits, dancing can also have numerous personal benefits. It can serve as a form of exercise and can help improve physical coordination and stamina. It can also be a great way to relieve stress and improve mental health. For these reasons, dancing can be an important part of a healthy lifestyle.\\nIn conclusion, I believe that dancing plays an important role in a culture. It serves as a form of artistic expression, brings people together, and can have personal benefits as well. Whether it be through traditional folk dances or modern performances, dance is an integral part of many cultures around the world and should be valued and celebrated.'\n",

Those who argue that higher education should be available to all students believe that everyone should have the opportunity to pursue higher education and gain the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the modern world. They argue that a college or university education can provide individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to secure good jobs and improve their quality of life.\\nOn the other hand, those who believe that higher education should be available only to good students argue that college and university resources are limited, and that these resources should be prioritized for students who are most likely to succeed. They argue that students who are not academically talented or motivated should not be given the opportunity to attend college or university, as they may struggle to keep up with the demands of higher education and may ultimately end up dropping out.\\nPersonally, I agree with the view that higher education should be available to all students. While it is true that some students may struggle more than others to succeed in higher education, I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to pursue higher education if they so choose. Higher education can be a transformative experience that helps individuals develop new skills and knowledge, and it can open up doors to new career opportunities and a better quality of life.\\nFurthermore, I believe that making higher education available to all students can have a positive impact on society as a whole. A more educated population can contribute to the overall prosperity and development of a country, and it can help to address social and economic inequalities. Additionally, I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to pursue their dreams and goals, regardless of their academic abilities.\\nIn conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate, I believe that higher education should be available to all students. Everyone should have the opportunity to pursue higher education and gain the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the modern world.'\n",

Other people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. Because I like meeting new people and like to learn as much as possible about the places I visit, I would prefer to travel with a group of people led by a tour guide. In this essay, I will explain my reasons.\\nFirst of all, by traveling in a group, we can benefit from the travel knowledge of our tour guide and our traveling companions and from the language skills of our tour guide. Without knowledge of the language, we might have great difficulty in communication. Also we should search for the places that we are going to visit in order to not to waste time. Because most of us are not professional tour guides, we cannot know all the important places that have to be visited. Tour guides can help us in different situations. So, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better than traveling alone. Many tour guides know at least two foreign languages, so they help us to communicate when we have trouble. Tour guides also give us information about the places that we visit, so the trip becomes even more informative.\\nSecondly, meeting new people can be very interesting when we travel in a group. We can build friendships that last forever. For example, two years ago, with my cousin, I went to Paris with on a tour with a group. There were almost thirty people in our group. We got along with each other very well. We went to restaurants all together, and it was really fun. If the number of people in a tour increases then, the transportation and hostelling costs decrease, and people can visit more places with less money.\\nIn conclusion, I can say that traveling in a group of people is the best way to travel. Traveling in a group allows us to save money, make good friends, have companionship, and learn important information about the place that we are visiting.'\n",
            " \"There are both advantages and disadvantages to living in university housing versus living in an apartment in the community. One advantage of living in university housing is that it can be convenient and cost-effective. University housing is typically located on or near campus, making it easy for students to access their classes and other campus resources. Additionally, university housing often includes meal plans and other amenities, which can save students money on food and other expenses.\\nAnother advantage of living in university housing is the opportunity to build community. Many university dormitories offer shared living spaces and social activities, which can help students form lasting friendships and support networks. This can be especially beneficial for students who are new to the area or who may be feeling homesick.\\nOn the other hand, there are also advantages to living in an apartment in the community. One advantage is the opportunity for greater independence. Living in an apartment allows students to have their own private space and to make their own decisions about how to decorate and furnish their living quarters. Additionally, living in an apartment may offer more privacy and quiet than living in a dormitory, which can be a major benefit for students who need to study or focus on their work.\\nAnother advantage of living in an apartment in the community is the opportunity to experience life outside of the university. Living in an apartment allows students to be a part of the larger community and to have access to a wider range of amenities and activities. This can be especially beneficial for students who want to get more involved in the local community or who are looking for new experiences.\\nPersonally, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community. While I see the value in the convenience and community-building aspects of university housing, I believe that the independence and opportunities for growth that come with living in an apartment would be more beneficial for me in the long run. I also appreciate the opportunity to experience life outside of the university and to be a part of the larger community. However, I recognize that the choice of where to live will depend on the individual student's needs and preferences, and that both university housing and apartments in the community have their own advantages and disadvantages.\"\n",

These include a renowned art museum, a colonial-era fort, and a number of churches and cathedrals that are architectural marvels.\\nIn addition to the cultural and historical attractions, the capital city also offers a range of other activities and entertainment options. There are numerous restaurants and cafes that serve a variety of local and international cuisines, as well as shopping districts and markets where visitors can purchase handmade crafts and souvenirs.\\nFurthermore, the capital city is a convenient choice for a one-day visit because it is usually well-connected by transportation, with an efficient public transportation system and a number of taxi and ride-sharing options. This makes it easy for the visitor to get around and see as much as possible within a limited time frame.\\nOverall, while there are many other interesting and beautiful places to visit in my country, the capital city offers a well-rounded and diverse experience that is perfect for a foreign visitor with just one day to spend.\"\n",

Many times this is expressed via the unexpected desire to study something we might have had the chance, but we before we never took it. For me such thing is astronomy. It appeals to me in so many ways, the mystery that accompanies the science of the universe has always attracted me in some magic way but I never took my chance. Now, if I am given such, I will not hesitate much before I take and below are some of my reasons for doing so.\\nAstronomy is the science that tries to give us a more profound knowledge about the Universe - the unimaginably big world that we are just a tiny part of. It give us a better look at worlds that we've never imagined exist and within the whole picture it tries to explain our own existence the way it is. Everyone of us has looked at the starry sky at night and at least a brief thought has come through out head of what's there, what are all this flickering lights and is somebody waiting for us millions of lights years away. Thoughts like this have always made us feel a little bit better in our existence, a little bit less lonely in our universe and science like Astronomy is that one that prove our hopes true, to make the dreams reality.\\nOn the other hand, Astronomy helps us understand better who we are, where do we come from, what is our place in the big picture and how do we function as an entity within it. Let's take for example the studies on the structure of the matter in the universe. Astronomers have proven the existence of substances that we considered unthinkable before and the knowledge they get from this inventions helps is go beyond the visible part in our own world, find the secrets of the matter that are hidden deeply in its existence on earth. We shouldn't also forget the recent discoveries regarding the Big Bang, considered the creation point of the Universe the way we know it today, and the help they provide us on understanding our origin as living beings. It helps us understand where are we heading for.\\nTaking all of the above mentioned, I can easily conclude that Astronomy for me is a way to broaden my mind, a way to look beyond the visible part of the world I live in, a feeling of belonging somewhere in the whole picture of the universe and, most of all, astronomy the knowledge that provides me with the confidence and hope that living beings on Earth are not alone in their existence.\"\n",

The world is changing, and because of the advanced technology we should always read and learn new things. We can't go on with the things we already know, that are why most of the companies arrange courses for their employees, for example courses for computer using or foreign language speaking.\\nIt is easy to do the same ordinary things all the time because you don't have to take any risks and so you can do your work quickly and perfectly. But this changes our lives into a monotone form. In a government building, most of us see workers chatting with each other and making long telephone calls on the phone. I think the reason why they act this way is because they do the same thing all the time and so they finish their work quickly and spend the rest of their time doing unnecessary things.\\nOne should always improve him by doing new thing and shouldn’t forget that it is never late. People can always make new starts in his life at all ages. A few days ago, I read an article and it was about the new starts of life. One story was about an old sailor who had offered 1,008 different men to start a restaurant business together and all the time the answer had been 'no'. But this man hadn't given up and finally he had gotten the answer 'yes'. If this old sailor, Colonel Sanders, hadn't been so willing to start a new business, we wouldn’t be eating Kentucky Fried Chicken today.\\nFinally I want to tell you about an exam I took last year in my economy course. The Professor had asked only one question and wanted us to write a four-page essay .The question was 'what's risk'. The student who got the highest mark in the exam hadn't written an essay. She had just left the 3 pages empty and written 'this is risk!!' at the bottom of the 4th page. When I think about it, it really was a risk not answering the question.

            " 'There is no doubt that attending a live performance can be an incredibly enjoyable experience. The energy and excitement of being in the same physical space as the performers, as well as the opportunity to immerse oneself in the atmosphere of the event, can add a level of enjoyment that is simply not possible when watching the same event on television.\\nOne reason why attending a live performance can be more enjoyable is the sense of community that it provides. When watching an event on television, one is essentially a spectator, sitting alone or with a small group of people and observing from a distance. However, when attending a live performance, one becomes part of a larger group of people all united in their love for the event. This sense of shared experience and connection to others can add an extra layer of enjoyment to the event.\\nAnother reason why attending a live performance can be more enjoyable is the opportunity to engage with the event on a deeper level. When watching an event on television, one is often limited to a fixed camera angle and may not get a full sense of the event as it unfolds. In contrast, attending a live performance allows one to move around and experience the event from different perspectives, making it a more immersive and interactive experience. Additionally, the ability to see and hear the event in person allows for a more nuanced appreciation of the performers and their talents.\\nFinally, attending a live performance can simply be more memorable and special than watching the same event on television. The memories and emotions associated with being at a live event can last a lifetime, and can be something to look back on with pride and joy. In contrast, watching an event on television may be enjoyable in the moment, but it may not leave the same lasting impact.\\nIn conclusion, while there is certainly value in being able to watch events on television, I believe that attending a live performance is generally more enjoyable. The sense of community, opportunity for deeper engagement, and lasting memories all contribute to this experience.'\n",
            " 'Most countries already have many holidays. In my country, Taiwan, we have nineteen official holidays. However, I believe that my new holiday, \"Walking Day\" would be very beneficial and should be added to the nineteen holidays Taiwan already has. In this essay, I will outline the three main reasons why \"Walking Day\" would be a very good holiday.\\nFirst, walking is good exercise. As we all know, people all over the world are becoming busier and busier. They are studying more and more so that they can have better jobs. When they work, they are working more and more. As a result, people have less time for other important things in their lives, including exercise. We can read reports in the newspapers everyday about people who have worse health and complain about poor health condition. Exercising more could reduce many of these problems and walking is one of the best and simplest exercises for people.\\nSecond, by walking, we can reduce pollution and thereby protect the environment. As technology improves all over the world and people have more and more money, they are starting to use this money to buy automobiles. As a result, people are using public transportation less and less. Driving one\\'s own car every day has had a very large impact on the environment as a result of the pollution created by gas burning automobiles. Walking is the perfect way to reduce pollution since there are so many other benefits as well.\\nFinally, by walking, people can slow down the pace of their lives. Perhaps this is one of the greatest benefits of walking more. Life at the beginning of the new millennium is stressful--people are competing with each other for better jobs, countries and companies are competing with each other for business. Many people start to forget about the importance of slowing down in their lives, of simply enjoying the moment. People need to contemplate life more. Walking is a perfect opportunity to slow down, think about life, and simply enjoy the big, beautiful world that we live in.\\nFinally, we could celebrate this holiday by encouraging people to walk instead of driving or taking the bus for at least one trip during the day. I believe that people could find at least one trip during the day that they could make on foot instead of some other form of transportation. For example, if people usually drive to a large supermarket to buy food, perhaps they could walk to a closer, smaller market to buy only a few things. I believe that while people were walking, they would be able to enjoy the exercise and the fresh air and would be able to think calmly and clearly.\\nIn short, if I had to create a new holiday, I would create \"Walking Day\" because of the many simple benefits it could provide us.'\n",

Certainly, no one would say she was not successful.\\nI also believe that being respected by co-workers indicates success. Without that, respect, money means little. For example, I once did some work for a top attorney in a law firm. He made a very good salary, but he was not a nice man. No one ever did work for him willingly. He ordered everyone around, and we didn’t respect him. In contrast, however, I had a wonderful band director in high school. He had to take extra jobs just to make enough money to support his family. However, his students had great respect for him and always listened to what he said. As a result, we were a very good band. In my opinion, my band director was more successful than the attorney was.\\nFinally, I think one of the most important indicators of success is knowledge. Wealthy people don’t know all the answers. For example, in the movie Good Will Hunting, the only person who could solve some complex problems was the janitor. He knew a lot, and decided what he wanted to do with that knowledge rather than just think about money. In my opinion, he was extremely successful.\\nWhen we think of history, there few people that we remember simply because they were rich. Overall, we remember people who did something with their lives-they were influential in politics, or contributed to science or art or religion. If history is the ultimate judge of success, then money surely isn’t everything.'\n",
            " 'One time when I was in Europe I saw this message in a gift store “Today problems will be the best experiences in the future”. I do agree with this idea. Although most experiences in our lives seem difficult, after overcome problems that these experiences involved, they become valuable lessons for the future.\\nDifficult experiences demand people to be strong. In my own experience, for instance, I lived one of the most difficult situation that a human being can live, which is to lose the most valuable person: the mother. Because I lost my mother when I was seven years old, I learned how to be responsible and take care of myself, and now I am an independent and strong person who can face any difficulty for severe that seemed.\\nOn the other hand, sometimes, difficult situations offer challenges that can change one’s life. For example, five years ago I won a scholarship to study a Master degree, and in compensation for this grant I was asked to do some work for the University where I was studying. They proposed me to be a teacher. Although I felt fearful and unconfident at the beginning, I accepted that challenge and I became to be an excellent teacher.\\nFinally, after overcome difficult situations people are able to handle any problem in a better way because they are already familiar dealing with unpleasant experiences. My own case illustrates it. After loosing my mother and being a teacher without previous experience, I have developed skills like control of stress and work under pressure that has allowed me to face any problem o challenge.\\nIn conclusion, people complain about having difficult experiences, but after all, they understand how living these situations in one of the better way to learn valuable lessons that will help them all their lives.'\n",
            " 'As a society, we are faced with many important issues that require funding and support in order to be addressed effectively. When it comes to deciding how to allocate resources, it can be difficult to choose between competing priorities. In this case, the decision is between supporting the arts or protecting the environment. Ultimately, I believe that the company should choose to protect the environment. Here are a few specific reasons why:\\nFirst and foremost, the environment is essential to our very survival. The air we breathe, the water we drink, and the resources we rely on all come from the natural world. If we do not take care of the environment, we risk damaging these vital systems and putting our own well-being at risk. In contrast, while the arts can bring joy and cultural enrichment, they are not necessary for our basic survival.\\nSecondly, protecting the environment has long-term benefits. Many environmental problems, such as climate change and pollution, take years or even decades to address. Investing in environmental protection now can help prevent or mitigate future problems, ensuring a better future for ourselves and future generations. In contrast, supporting the arts is more of a short-term solution, providing enjoyment in the present but not necessarily having a lasting impact.\\nFinally, protecting the environment has the potential to benefit a wide range of people and industries. For example, investing in clean energy or conservation efforts can create jobs and stimulate economic growth. It can also help preserve natural resources, which can be used sustainably to benefit local communities. In contrast, supporting the arts may only directly benefit a small group of people, such as artists or those who regularly attend cultural events.\\nIn conclusion, while both supporting the arts and protecting the environment are important and worthy causes, I believe that the company should prioritize protecting the environment. The environment is essential to our survival and has long-term benefits that can improve the lives of a wide range of people. By investing in environmental protection, the company can help ensure a better future for all of us.'\n",
            " 'If I had the chance to travel back in time to meet a famous person from history, I would like to meet German scientist Albert Einstein, because I consider him being the best physicist of all times and an extraordinary intellectual. He made a valuable contribution to humanity.\\nBorn in German in 1870’s, Einstein became the most famous scientist of the twentieth century. His studies revolutionized and reshaped scientific thinking. I find interesting the complexity of his mind and spirit. He was in conflict with his deep religious feelings, he said that the Bible could not be literally true, and these thoughts also allowed Einstein to discard scientific prejudices. He stated that problems couldn’t be solved at the same level of awareness that created them. His creativity amazes me, after Einstein’s work, space and time would never again be the same.\\nNot only his scientific work is fascinating to me, but also his sense of humor, just to give an example of that I will tell that he once said that gravitation cannot be held responsible for people falling in love. He was an undoubted revolutionary, an innovator and also a philosopher and a pacifist. He believed that he owed his success to imagination, that fantasy had meant more to him than the talent for absorbing knowledge. I totally agree with him about that. Since I am interested in science I admire him very much for his great contribution to humanity, I would have been pleased to meet him and work with the genius and emblematic Master of Science that he was.\\nTo conclude I say that I would choose to meet Einstein who is acknowledged as the greatest physicist that ever lived because I have always found fascinating his reasoning and the significant contribution to science he had made.'\n",
            " 'As a resident of [your country], I believe that the development of a new research center in agriculture would be the most beneficial for our country.\\nThere are several reasons why a research center focused on agriculture would be more beneficial for [your country] than one focused on business.\\nFirst, agriculture is a vital industry for many countries, including [your country]. It plays a crucial role in our economy and is a major source of employment for many of our citizens. Developing a research center that focuses on improving agricultural practices and technologies would not only benefit the agriculture industry, but it would also have a ripple effect on the economy as a whole.\\nSecond, a research center focused on agriculture would have the opportunity to address some of the pressing issues facing the industry in [your country]. For example, our country may be facing challenges such as drought, pests, or soil degradation, and a research center focused on agriculture could work on finding solutions to these problems. This would not only benefit the agriculture industry, but it would also have a positive impact on the environment and the well-being of our citizens.\\nFinally, a research center focused on agriculture would align with the values and priorities of our country. [Your country] has a strong tradition of valuing the land and our agricultural heritage, and a research center focused on agriculture would be a way to honor and build upon this tradition.\\nIn conclusion, I recommend that the university develop a new research center focused on agriculture for [your country]. This decision would benefit the agriculture industry, address pressing issues facing the industry, and align with the values and priorities of our country.']\n",

        "\n",
        "In recent years, social media has emerged as a transformative force that has revolutionized the way people interact, communicate, and engage with the world around them. This technological phenomenon, driven by platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, has fundamentally reshaped various aspects of society. While its influence spans across the globe, the impact of social media on society is a topic of both celebration and concern.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most remarkable aspects of social media is its ability to connect individuals across geographical boundaries, fostering a sense of global community. People can easily communicate with friends, family, and even strangers from different corners of the world, breaking down barriers and opening up new avenues for cross-cultural exchange. Social media has enabled the rapid dissemination of information, allowing users to stay updated on news, events, and trends in real time.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the pervasive nature of social media also raises significant concerns. One prominent issue is the potential for misinformation and the rapid spread of fake news. The viral nature of content on social media platforms can lead to the amplification of unverified or biased information, which can have serious consequences on public perceptions and decision-making. Moreover, the constant exposure to curated content on social media may contribute to the creation of echo chambers, where individuals are surrounded by like-minded opinions, reinforcing existing beliefs and inhibiting constructive dialogue.\n",
        "\n",
        "The psychological impact of social media is another area of scrutiny. The quest for validation through likes, shares, and comments can lead to feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and even depression, especially among younger users. The phenomenon of comparing one's life to the carefully crafted portrayals on social media, known as \"social media envy,\" has been linked to a negative impact on mental health.\n",
        "\n",
        "On a positive note, social media has empowered individuals and marginalized groups to raise their voices and advocate for social justice. Movements like #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo have gained momentum through social media platforms, shedding light on systemic issues and driving collective action for change.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the impact of social media on society is a complex interplay of benefits and challenges. It has undoubtedly bridged gaps, empowered voices, and facilitated global connectivity. However, it also raises concerns about misinformation, mental health, and the erosion of authentic human interactions. As we continue to navigate this digital landscape, it is crucial to strike a balance between leveraging the positive potential of social media while being mindful of its potential pitfalls. Society's ability to harness the power of social media for positive change will ultimately define its long-term influence.''']))"
